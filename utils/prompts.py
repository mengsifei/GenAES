Youâ€™re required to do four tasks. 

First of all, answer, if the essay is off-topic. If the essay and the given prompt are about different concepts, for example, the essay is about crime, and the prompt is about technology, then it means it's off-topic. Point it out.

Secondly, please provide feedback for the essay with evidence from the original essay. 

Thirdly, take the statistics from {{STATS}} and answer the question if the essay has more than 250 words.

Lastly, correct all spelling, grammar, and punctuation mistakes in the essay without altering its ideas. Preserve all paragraph breaks and line breaks exactly as they appear in the original text if the structure is appropriate. Refine paragraph structure if needed.
