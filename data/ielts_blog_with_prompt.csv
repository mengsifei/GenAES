Without capital punishment our lives are less secure and crimes or violence increase. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"Serious crimes need capital punishment so that the offender are unable to get involved in the crime in the future. However, If they want to stop the acts of violation in the future then it would be better to forget him and judge him for a change .

Overall, I agree with the fact that punishment is the way to avoid the  crime to be increased and hence our lives become more secure. If the wrongdoer wants to be a good  man and there is a particular financial or personal problem that led him to the wrong way, then it would be the nice option to forgive him and try to solve the problem he  have. Although by this way, some bad  man may become effective  part of the society but some do not bring themselves to the right path because they are  very much used to of it. The person that _ involved in the crime and never  try to stop the law-breaking act should be punished in  the extremely serious way. However, it totally depends on the nature of crime. Some  crime led to a capital punishment and some may require a small penalty. The law-making institutions are responsible to bring the bad man to the right level of punishment that he deserves. If there is weak legislation to properly handle the offender, it may  become our society less secure for the good  man. The government should be  the responsible authority to provide a secure and better state to live. Laws should be implemented and executed in the most proper way that do not allow the offender to commit violent acts or to break the law in any way and to any extent. To sum up, it is the responsibility of the state runner to stop people to involved in crime. It may be done through solving the problems of the people that led them to commit that violence act or by the punishment accordingly.","[Fixed Criteria]

- 8 means ""The prompt is appropriately and sufficiently addressed. A clear and well-developed position is presented in response to the question/s. Ideas are relevant, well extended and supported. There may be occasional omissions or lapses in content.""
- 7 means ""The main parts of the prompt are appropriately addressed. A clear and developed position is presented. Main ideas are extended and supported but there may be a tendency to over-generalise or there may be a lack of focus and precision in supporting ideas/material.""
- 6 means ""The main parts of the prompt are addressed (though some may be more fully covered than others). An appropriate format is used. A position is presented that is directly relevant to the prompt, although the conclusions drawn may be unclear, unjustified or repetitive. Main ideas are relevant, but some may be insufficiently developed or may lack clarity, while some supporting arguments and evidence may be less relevant or inadequate.""
- 5 means ""The main parts of the prompt are incompletely addressed. The format may be inappropriate in places. The writer expresses a position, but the development is not always clear. Some main ideas are put forward, but they are limited and are not sufficiently developed and/or there may be irrelevant detail. There may be some repetition."" A
- 4 means ""The prompt is tackled in a minimal way, or the answer is tangential, possibly due to some misunderstanding of the prompt. The format may be inappropriate. A position is discernible, but the reader has to read carefully to find it. Main ideas are difficult to identify and such ideas that are identifiable may lack relevance, clarity and/or support. Large parts of the response may be repetitive.""
- 3 means ""No part of the prompt is adequately addressed, or the prompt has been misunderstood. No relevant position can be identified, and/or there is little direct response to the question/s. There are few ideas, and these may be irrelevant or insufficiently developed.""
- 2 means ""The content is barely related to the prompt. No position can be identified. There may be glimpses of one or two ideas without development.""
- 1 means ""Responses of 20 words or fewer are rated at Band 1. The content is wholly unrelated to the prompt.""
For ""Coherence and Cohesion"":
- 9 (the highest band) means ""The message can be followed effortlessly. Cohesion is used in such a way that it very rarely attracts attention. Any lapses in coherence or cohesion are minimal. Paragraphing is skilfully managed.
- 8 means ""The message can be followed with ease. Information and ideas are logically sequenced, and cohesion is well managed. Occasional lapses in coherence or cohesion may occur. Paragraphing is used sufficiently and appropriately.""

- 6 means ""Information and ideas are generally arranged coherently and there is a clear overall progression. Cohesive devices are used to some good effect but cohesion within and/or between sentences may be faulty or mechanical due to misuse, overuse or omission. The use of reference and substitution may lack flexibility or clarity and result in some repetition or error.
- 5 means ""Organisation is evident but is not wholly logical and there may be a lack of overall progression. Nevertheless, there is a sense of underlying coherence to the response. The relationship of ideas can be followed but the sentences are not fluently linked to each other. There may be limited/overuse of cohesive devices with some inaccuracy. The writing may be repetitive due to inadequate and/or inaccurate use of reference and substitution.""
- 4 means ""Information and ideas are evident but not arranged coherently, and there is no clear progression within the response. Relationships between ideas can be unclear and/or inadequately marked. There is some use of basic cohesive devices, which may be inaccurate or repetitive.

idiomatic items when appropriate, despite occasional inaccuracies in word choice and collocation. Occasional errors in spelling and/or word formation may occur, but have minimal impact on communication.""
- 7 means ""The resource is sufficient to allow some flexibility and precision. There is some ability to use less common and/or idiomatic items. An awareness of style and collocation is evident, though inappropriacies occur. There are only a few errors in spelling and/or word formation, and they do not detract from overall clarity"".
- 6 means ""The resource is generally adequate and appropriate for the task. The meaning is generally clear in spite of a rather restricted range or a lack of precision in word choice. If the writer is a risk-taker, there will be a wider range of vocabulary used but higher degrees of inaccuracy or inappropriacy.There are some errors in spelling and/or word formation, but these do not impede communication.""
- 5 means ""The resource is limited but minimally adequate for the task. Simple vocabulary may be used accurately but the range does not permit much variation in expression.

            [Task]
            You are an IELTS examiner, and you are required to evaluate an IELTS academic essay based on four specific criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. Each criterion should be rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 represents the highest level of proficiency and 1 the lowest.
            The detailed criteria is the text till the tag [Topic]. The essay topic is the text between [Topic] and the tag [Essay]. The essay that you need to evaluate is the text between the tag [Essay] and the tag [Task]. 
            
            ""Task Response"" evaluates how well the candidate fully answers the question and develops his or her ideas. Responses must be a minimum of 250 words. If the essay has 200-250 words, you should subtract 1 point from the Task Response score you would like to give to the student. If the essay has 20-200 words - subtract 2 points. If the essay has fewer than 20 words, you should assign a score of 1 for all criteria. If the essay is totally off-topic, you should assign a 2 to this criterion.
            ""Coherence and Cohesion"" evaluates the overall clarity and fluency of the message: how the response organizes and links information, ideas, and language. Coherence refers to the logical sequencing of ideas, while cohesion refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (for example, logical connectors, pronouns, and conjunctions) to clarify conceptual and referential relationships between and within sentences.
            ""Lexical Resource"" refers to the range of vocabulary the candidate has used, as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of that use in relation to the specific task. Academic style is welcomed, you should subtract 2 points if the essay is not academic. 
            ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy refers to the variety and accuracy of the candidate's grammar, including the use of punctuation.
            
            You will provide detailed feedback and scores for each criterion, scores are a must have. The feedback must include evidence from the original essay and reference the grading criteria to support your ideas.
            
            The output format should include:
            • ""Task Response feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes word count, overall correspondence between topic and essay, and unity of ideas in each paragraph. If the essay is off-topic, you should point this out with evidence.  
            • ""Coherence and Cohesion feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes use of linking words and number of paragraphs. Appropriate use of linking words and substitutions should be rewarded. The desired number of paragraphs is between 3 and 10. Essays that do not follow this structure should be penalized. 
            • ""Lexical Resource feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay.

            [Task]
            You are an IELTS examiner, and you are required to evaluate an IELTS academic essay based on four specific criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. Each criterion should be rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 represents the highest level of proficiency and 1 the lowest.
            The detailed criteria is the text till the tag [Topic]. The essay topic is the text between [Topic] and the tag [Essay]. The essay that you need to evaluate is the text between the tag [Essay] and the tag [Task]. 
            
            ""Task Response"" evaluates how well the candidate fully answers the question and develops his or her ideas. Responses must be a minimum of 250 words. If the essay has 200-250 words, you should subtract 1 point from the Task Response score you would like to give to the student. If the essay has 20-200 words - subtract 2 points. If the essay has fewer than 20 words, you should assign a score of 1 for all criteria. If the essay is totally off-topic, you should assign a 2 to this criterion.
            ""Coherence and Cohesion"" evaluates the overall clarity and fluency of the message: how the response organizes and links information, ideas, and language. Coherence refers to the logical sequencing of ideas, while cohesion refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (for example, logical connectors, pronouns, and conjunctions) to clarify conceptual and referential relationships between and within sentences.
            ""Lexical Resource"" refers to the range of vocabulary the candidate has used, as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of that use in relation to the specific task. Academic style is welcomed, you should subtract 2 points if the essay is not academic. 
            ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy refers to the variety and accuracy of the candidate's grammar, including the use of punctuation.
            
            You will provide detailed feedback and scores for each criterion, scores are a must have. The feedback must include evidence from the original essay and reference the grading criteria to support your ideas.
            
            The output format should include:
            • ""Task Response feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes word count, overall correspondence between topic and essay, and unity of ideas in each paragraph. If the essay is off-topic, you should point this out with evidence.  
            • ""Coherence and Cohesion feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes use of linking words and number of paragraphs. Appropriate use of linking words and substitutions should be rewarded. The desired number of paragraphs is between 3 and 10. Essays that do not follow this structure should be penalized. 
            • ""Lexical Resource feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes number and example of B2, C1, C2 words based on CEFR complexity, noticeable word repetition, spelling mistakes. Appropriate and more complicated words will be rewarded; inappropriate word choice, oral style, and noticeable word repetition will be penalized. Spelling errors should be corrected. 
            • ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes grammar concepts used, grammar errors, use of complex sentences, including B2, C1, C2 sentences based on CEFR complexity, clauses, sentence length, punctuation errors. Complex sentences and the variety of grammatical resources used should be rewarded. Grammar and punctuation errors should be penalized and corrected.
            
            Based on the [Fixed Criteria] provided earlier and the feedback for each criterion, you are required to assign scores in the following format:

            [Task]
            You are an IELTS examiner, and you are required to evaluate an IELTS academic essay based on four specific criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. Each criterion should be rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 represents the highest level of proficiency and 1 the lowest.
            The detailed criteria is the text till the tag [Topic]. The essay topic is the text between [Topic] and the tag [Essay]. The essay that you need to evaluate is the text between the tag [Essay] and the tag [Task]. 
            
            ""Task Response"" evaluates how well the candidate fully answers the question and develops his or her ideas. Responses must be a minimum of 250 words. If the essay has 200-250 words, you should subtract 1 point from the Task Response score you would like to give to the student. If the essay has 20-200 words - subtract 2 points. If the essay has fewer than 20 words, you should assign a score of 1 for all criteria. If the essay is totally off-topic, you should assign a 2 to this criterion.
            ""Coherence and Cohesion"" evaluates the overall clarity and fluency of the message: how the response organizes and links information, ideas, and language. Coherence refers to the logical sequencing of ideas, while cohesion refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (for example, logical connectors, pronouns, and conjunctions) to clarify conceptual and referential relationships between and within sentences.
            ""Lexical Resource"" refers to the range of vocabulary the candidate has used, as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of that use in relation to the specific task. Academic style is welcomed, you should subtract 2 points if the essay is not academic.

Boys are most influenced by their fathers and girls are most influenced by their mothers. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons to support your opinion.,"It is true that nowadays parent have a great influence over the  children. Some people hold the opinion that the same sex is the major determination of influencing parent, but others have a negative attitude. As far as I am concerned, I agree that boys are most influenced by their fathers and girls are most influenced by their mothers. My arguments for this point are listed below.

First of all, a father is the person who have already passed that ways  which are his son is passing now, in other words, sons are following their father’s footsteps. So, based on experience it is easy for a father to notice his sons’ drawbacks and to influence them.

Secondly, it is true that a boy is countedas a strong characteristics human , but a girl is a subtle and fragile one. It is hard for mothers to influence their sons, because it is not likely that vulnerable something can affect a strong one.

In conclusion, it seems to me unfair that boys are most influenced by their mothers. Based on at least two points above I strongly agree that children are influenced by a parent of the same gender.","[Fixed Criteria]

    ""Boys are most influenced by their fathers and girls are most influenced by their mothers. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons to support your opinion.""

    [Essay]
    ""It is true that nowadays parent have a great influence over the  children. Some people hold the opinion that the same sex is the major determination of influencing parent, but others have a negative attitude. As far as I am concerned, I agree that boys are most influenced by their fathers and girls are most influenced by their mothers. My arguments for this point are listed below.

First of all, a father is the person who have already passed that ways  which are his son is passing now, in other words, sons are following their father’s footsteps. So, based on experience it is easy for a father to notice his sons’ drawbacks and to influence them.

Secondly, it is true that a boy is countedas a strong characteristics human , but a girl is a subtle and fragile one. It is hard for mothers to influence their sons, because it is not likely that vulnerable something can affect a strong one.

In conclusion, it seems to me unfair that boys are most influenced by their mothers. Based on at least two points above I strongly agree that children are influenced by a parent of the same gender.""
    
            [Task]
            You are an IELTS examiner, and you are required to evaluate an IELTS academic essay based on four specific criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. Each criterion should be rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 represents the highest level of proficiency and 1 the lowest.
            The detailed criteria is the text till the tag [Topic]. The essay topic is the text between [Topic] and the tag [Essay]. The essay that you need to evaluate is the text between the tag [Essay] and the tag [Task]. 
            
            ""Task Response"" evaluates how well the candidate fully answers the question and develops his or her ideas. Responses must be a minimum of 250 words. If the essay has 200-250 words, you should subtract 1 point from the Task Response score you would like to give to the student. If the essay has 20-200 words - subtract 2 points. If the essay has fewer than 20 words, you should assign a score of 1 for all criteria. If the essay is totally off-topic, you should assign a 2 to this criterion.
            ""Coherence and Cohesion"" evaluates the overall clarity and fluency of the message: how the response organizes and links information, ideas, and language. Coherence refers to the logical sequencing of ideas, while cohesion refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (for example, logical connectors, pronouns, and conjunctions) to clarify conceptual and referential relationships between and within sentences.
            ""Lexical Resource"" refers to the range of vocabulary the candidate has used, as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of that use in relation to the specific task. Academic style is welcomed, you should subtract 2 points if the essay is not academic. 
            ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy refers to the variety and accuracy of the candidate's grammar, including the use of punctuation.
            
            You will provide detailed feedback and scores for each criterion, scores are a must have. The feedback must include evidence from the original essay and reference the grading criteria to support your ideas.
            
            The output format should include:
            • ""Task Response feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes word count, overall correspondence between topic and essay, and unity of ideas in each paragraph. If the essay is off-topic, you should point this out with evidence.  
            • ""Coherence and Cohesion feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes use of linking words and number of paragraphs. Appropriate use of linking words and substitutions should be rewarded. The desired number of paragraphs is between 3 and 10. Essays that do not follow this structure should be penalized. 
            • ""Lexical Resource feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes number and example of B2, C1, C2 words based on CEFR complexity, noticeable word repetition, spelling mistakes. Appropriate and more complicated words will be rewarded; inappropriate word choice, oral style, and noticeable word repetition will be penalized. Spelling errors should be corrected. 
            • ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes grammar concepts used, grammar errors, use of complex sentences, including B2, C1, C2 sentences based on CEFR complexity, clauses, sentence length, punctuation errors. Complex sentences and the variety of grammatical resources used should be rewarded. Grammar and punctuation errors should be penalized and corrected.
            
            Based on the [Fixed Criteria] provided earlier and the feedback for each criterion, you are required to assign scores in the following format:
            • ""Task Response score"": An integer score from 1 to 9.      
            • ""Coherence and Cohesion score"": An integer score from 1 to 9.
            • ""Lexical Resource score"": An integer score from 1 to 9.
            • ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy score"": An integer score from 1 to 9.
            Remember, your feedback should be supported with quotes from the original essay. 
            
            The output should look like this and each key should strictly have the name demonstrated bellow: 
            ""Task Response feedback"": 2-5 sentences with all evidence, ""Coherence and Cohesion feedback"":  2-5 sentences with all evidence, ""Lexical Resource feedback"":  2-5 sentences with all evidence, ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy feedback"":  2-5 sentences with all evidence, ""Task Response score"": an integer, ""Coherence and Cohesion score"": an integer, ""Lexical Resource score"": an integer, ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy score"": an integer.

Some people believe that having a pet such as a cat or a dog helps old people to live a more enjoyable life and to stay healthier.  How do you think old people benefit from having a pet?  Do you think there are any problems related to old people who have pets?,"In term of physical benefits, the well-being conditions of elderly people with pets are more favourable compared to those without pets, since not only do they have to take care of themselves, __ the responsibility that ensure their love one being fed and well looked after encourages them to become even more active. Due to these extra activities, this though might not have an obvious influence on their health, but at least this could help them to avoid bad living styles. Coupled with physical side, their mental wellbeing will also be improved, and the reason is that having someone to take care of would reduce the chance of feeling  loneliness. Therefore, their depressing rate could be minimised.

In spite of the above advantages, the threats of too close interaction between pets and vulnerable old people still exist. One of the major concerns is the harmfulness of these animal hairs on their tracheas, especially those with asthma. Because of the virtually invisible in the air, many asthma symptoms are caused unconsciously by pets. In addition to the fact that old people might experience difficulty in looking after their pets, as their health conditions are limited, which could become even more challenge when they try t take care of others.

In conclusion, it is true that obstacles still exist for elderly people in adopting pets, but the benefits of this topic outnumber its shortages. For such reasons, instead of discontinuing them, further support would be far more beneficial.","[Fixed Criteria]

There is no longer enough natural resources to sustain current levels of economic growth. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Recently, the demands of natural resources have risen dramatically across the world due to population growth. Some people state that we have not enough resources. However, there are some individuals who disagree with this opinion. In this essay, the issues behind this phenomenon will be examined.

On the one hand, some people state that if the number of natural resource will continue to  degrease we cannot have a comfortable life because natural resources are limited. According to a government research in the USA shows that if this situation will continue, the petrol will lose in 2050. Moreover, it is widely said that the number of population in the world will increase. This will make the amount of natural resource decrease.

On the other hand, there are some individuals who disagree with above-mentioned perception. The demands of  natural resources will be lessen owning to improving the technology. For example, the developments of technology such as electronic cars gave a positive impact in the society. By using this, we can decline the consumption of natural resources. Eventually, we will not need natural fuel. In my opinion, decreasing of natural resource is quite crisis, I think the loss of it give a negative impact in the society because even we won’t have a comfortable life any more.

In conclusion, I agree with the idea that there is no longer enough natural resources to sustain this situation. In order to defense our life, the governments every countries should tackle this issue.","[Fixed Criteria]

    ""There is no longer enough natural resources to sustain current levels of economic growth. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?""

    [Essay]
    ""Recently, the demands of natural resources have risen dramatically across the world due to population growth. Some people state that we have not enough resources. However, there are some individuals who disagree with this opinion. In this essay, the issues behind this phenomenon will be examined.

On the one hand, some people state that if the number of natural resource will continue to  degrease we cannot have a comfortable life because natural resources are limited. According to a government research in the USA shows that if this situation will continue, the petrol will lose in 2050. Moreover, it is widely said that the number of population in the world will increase. This will make the amount of natural resource decrease.

On the other hand, there are some individuals who disagree with above-mentioned perception. The demands of  natural resources will be lessen owning to improving the technology. For example, the developments of technology such as electronic cars gave a positive impact in the society. By using this, we can decline the consumption of natural resources. Eventually, we will not need natural fuel. In my opinion, decreasing of natural resource is quite crisis, I think the loss of it give a negative impact in the society because even we won’t have a comfortable life any more.

In conclusion, I agree with the idea that there is no longer enough natural resources to sustain this situation. In order to defense our life, the governments every countries should tackle this issue.""
    
            [Task]
            You are an IELTS examiner, and you are required to evaluate an IELTS academic essay based on four specific criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. Each criterion should be rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 represents the highest level of proficiency and 1 the lowest.
            The detailed criteria is the text till the tag [Topic]. The essay topic is the text between [Topic] and the tag [Essay]. The essay that you need to evaluate is the text between the tag [Essay] and the tag [Task]. 
            
            ""Task Response"" evaluates how well the candidate fully answers the question and develops his or her ideas. Responses must be a minimum of 250 words. If the essay has 200-250 words, you should subtract 1 point from the Task Response score you would like to give to the student. If the essay has 20-200 words - subtract 2 points. If the essay has fewer than 20 words, you should assign a score of 1 for all criteria. If the essay is totally off-topic, you should assign a 2 to this criterion.
            ""Coherence and Cohesion"" evaluates the overall clarity and fluency of the message: how the response organizes and links information, ideas, and language. Coherence refers to the logical sequencing of ideas, while cohesion refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (for example, logical connectors, pronouns, and conjunctions) to clarify conceptual and referential relationships between and within sentences.
            ""Lexical Resource"" refers to the range of vocabulary the candidate has used, as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of that use in relation to the specific task. Academic style is welcomed, you should subtract 2 points if the essay is not academic. 
            ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy refers to the variety and accuracy of the candidate's grammar, including the use of punctuation.

Financial education should be a mandatory component of the school program. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"In many countries the discussion about the rising financial problems of young people has been getting more emphasis. Tough some people are voting to integrate financial education as a schooling subject.

The key problem for many young people is that they don’t know how to use and spend money in the right way. The “get what you want mentality” is widely advertised by the mass media and it looks like some people think that living with interest fees is normal. Though financial problems in young life are very common with the result that it is difficult to learn how to spend money appropriated. The main idea of teaching a financial subject must be to explain about a balanced budget and that debt could ruins one’s future.

But this is just one side that has to be considered. For me, the main question is why the parents cannot give the right advice to their kids? To leave such a personal subject in the hands of government and school means to ignore a key task of any parent: to be a good role model.

Moreover it should be considerate that the social effects of talking about money and finance in a socially diverse school class can be harmful for some students. In my opinion it is more important to teach parents about their responsibilities as a role model and have them educate the children about this private topic in a safe and private environment.

All in all I think the main task of public institutions should be to educate about common subjects and not to give such personal advice like the use of money.","[Fixed Criteria]

“Some people say that the education system is the only critical factor to development of a country. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?”,"Education plays a vital role in the development of a country. Therefore, some people think that the education system is the only important factor to the development of a country and they may be right.

Education is the foundation of well developed society. It is rightly said, ‘education is a ladder for success’. If all the people of any country are educated then they becomes broadminded, civilized and progressive. An educated society improves the standard of life as well.

Not only this, but also by giving importance to education, the nations can get rid of problems like iliteracy, poverty, unemployment and population growth that delay the progress of a nation. The crime rate can also be kept under check. The standard of living of the people will go up. If the nations wants to be progressive it is very important that the people are more educated and progressive. Any country can become more technologically advanced and developed because of education.","[Fixed Criteria]

    ""“Some people say that the education system is the only critical factor to development of a country. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?”""

    [Essay]
    ""Education plays a vital role in the development of a country. Therefore, some people think that the education system is the only important factor to the development of a country and they may be right.

Education is the foundation of well developed society. It is rightly said, ‘education is a ladder for success’. If all the people of any country are educated then they becomes broadminded, civilized and progressive. An educated society improves the standard of life as well.

Not only this, but also by giving importance to education, the nations can get rid of problems like iliteracy, poverty, unemployment and population growth that delay the progress of a nation. The crime rate can also be kept under check. The standard of living of the people will go up. If the nations wants to be progressive it is very important that the people are more educated and progressive. Any country can become more technologically advanced and developed because of education.""
    
            [Task]
            You are an IELTS examiner, and you are required to evaluate an IELTS academic essay based on four specific criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. Each criterion should be rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 represents the highest level of proficiency and 1 the lowest.
            The detailed criteria is the text till the tag [Topic]. The essay topic is the text between [Topic] and the tag [Essay]. The essay that you need to evaluate is the text between the tag [Essay] and the tag [Task]. 
            
            ""Task Response"" evaluates how well the candidate fully answers the question and develops his or her ideas. Responses must be a minimum of 250 words. If the essay has 200-250 words, you should subtract 1 point from the Task Response score you would like to give to the student. If the essay has 20-200 words - subtract 2 points.

            ""Coherence and Cohesion"" evaluates the overall clarity and fluency of the message: how the response organizes and links information, ideas, and language. Coherence refers to the logical sequencing of ideas, while cohesion refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (for example, logical connectors, pronouns, and conjunctions) to clarify conceptual and referential relationships between and within sentences.
            ""Lexical Resource"" refers to the range of vocabulary the candidate has used, as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of that use in relation to the specific task. Academic style is welcomed, you should subtract 2 points if the essay is not academic. 
            ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy refers to the variety and accuracy of the candidate's grammar, including the use of punctuation.

"Even though globalization affects the world’s economy in a very positive way, its negative side should not be forgotten.

Globalazation is gaining speen over the entire world. It has attract enough world attention needed from international organization in promoting and encouraging human right and freedom , opportunities, economic, social and culture rights.

However, there are some countries that are missing out the opportunities that are offered and its taken as a big problem to their country. They are the poorer countries that are not connected to the people globally and their people are unskilled due to the lack of knowledge and equipments. They are also unable to trade with the other countries which are richer and larger as they are unable to meet the demand propose of them. They also will not have the opportunities and the challenges that are require.

Globalization has also encourage crimes like the illegal drug trafficking around the world through the air, sea and land. This has involved human smuggling and stuffing it in anything they come across. This has affected a lot of problems to the country and the families of the drug addicts. This will also lead to other crimes like robbery and violence in the country.

Another negative side of globalization is the dumping of the dangerous waste to the river, sea or the ocean. This will effect the aquactic creature, contaninate the water and cause harm to the people too.

Financial education should be a mandatory component of the school program.  To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Children in this modern era have all the magnificent toys, food and many more other interesting things thanin the past. They are bound to have a craving on  all this stuff that they see. In other words children will be spending money on anything they want or find it interesting to them. Even some adults these days have some kind of craving to the thing they find it amazing. 

If financial education starts at the very beginning of the school years, this will help them to understand the value of money. Children should also be taught to manage their expenses and ways to spend wisely.  When a child is being taught this in the school program, the child will be able to apply it when they are out to purchase or when they have left the school. They will not be cheated when they are young and this will not only benefit their families but also the whole country where they live when they are older.

However, there are some children that are capable of handle the their financial  in a very positive way even before they learned it at school. This children would have learnt from their families or people around them. They manage money better, compared to the other children from wealthier families for whom spending is not a problem.","[Fixed Criteria]

    ""Financial education should be a mandatory component of the school program.  To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?""

    [Essay]
    ""Children in this modern era have all the magnificent toys, food and many more other interesting things thanin the past. They are bound to have a craving on  all this stuff that they see. In other words children will be spending money on anything they want or find it interesting to them. Even some adults these days have some kind of craving to the thing they find it amazing. 

If financial education starts at the very beginning of the school years, this will help them to understand the value of money. Children should also be taught to manage their expenses and ways to spend wisely.  When a child is being taught this in the school program, the child will be able to apply it when they are out to purchase or when they have left the school. They will not be cheated when they are young and this will not only benefit their families but also the whole country where they live when they are older.

However, there are some children that are capable of handle the their financial  in a very positive way even before they learned it at school. This children would have learnt from their families or people around them. They manage money better, compared to the other children from wealthier families for whom spending is not a problem.""
    
            [Task]
            You are an IELTS examiner, and you are required to evaluate an IELTS academic essay based on four specific criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. Each criterion should be rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 represents the highest level of proficiency and 1 the lowest.
            The detailed criteria is the text till the tag [Topic]. The essay topic is the text between [Topic] and the tag [Essay]. The essay that you need to evaluate is the text between the tag [Essay] and the tag [Task]. 
            
            ""Task Response"" evaluates how well the candidate fully answers the question and develops his or her ideas. Responses must be a minimum of 250 words. If the essay has 200-250 words, you should subtract 1 point from the Task Response score you would like to give to the student. If the essay has 20-200 words - subtract 2 points.

            ""Coherence and Cohesion"" evaluates the overall clarity and fluency of the message: how the response organizes and links information, ideas, and language. Coherence refers to the logical sequencing of ideas, while cohesion refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (for example, logical connectors, pronouns, and conjunctions) to clarify conceptual and referential relationships between and within sentences.
            ""Lexical Resource"" refers to the range of vocabulary the candidate has used, as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of that use in relation to the specific task. Academic style is welcomed, you should subtract 2 points if the essay is not academic. 
            ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy refers to the variety and accuracy of the candidate's grammar, including the use of punctuation.

"Millions of people every year move to English- speaking countries such as Australia, Britain or America, in order to study at school, college or university. Why do so many people want to study in English? Why is English such an important international language?","Nowadays, language becomes a major factor to become a successful person. Many people prefer to study abroad to English-speaking country because English is an international language. There is no doubt that the best way to improve the English language skill is to use the English language daily so if people study in English speaking countries, their English skill will be improved automatically and it will give them some advantages such as they can work in many countries or they will be able travelling  to many different places without studying other languages. This essay will describe in detail why English is an important international language.__

Firstly, the English language is widely used in many countries and at present, the world traders are currently developing rapidly. In order to compete with people from different countries, it is very essential to be able to communicate with the English language. For example, China has been improving a lot in many sectors. They are able to compete with other countries because many people in China aware the important  English language and they are trying hard to study English.

Secondly, many companies prefer to employ people who can speak English because if the companies create new branch in different countries, the employers are able to move the new branch without employ new people and the branch company is still able to communicate with the central company. In fact, one of the largest companies in the world (Google) has created some branch in different countries and each of the Google employers is able to discuss things or otherwise communicate even though they are in different countries because they all use English  to communicate.

In conclusion, many people move to English speaking countries for further studies because they believe that it will improve their English skills and in order to become a successful person in the future, mastering English is very essential.","[Fixed Criteria]

"You can get up-to-date news from the radio, TV and the Internet. Which kind of media do you think is the best to get the news?","Nowadays, there are several channels to get news, such as the radio, TV, newspapers and the Internet. I think the Internet is the best among these.  In my essay, I am going to explain why.

Since its invention, the Internet has been booming as a prospective industry. Not only because it is a combination of text, audio and video, but also due to its convinience. It has threatened the domination of spreading news of the traditional media, and, I would say, is about to take control.

We can find everything we want on the Internet – the latest news, books, songs, movies, cartoons…  whatever. With the radio, we can merely hear. Compared to a newspaper, the radio and TV can provide the latest information. For instance the breaking news of the Americans’ attacking Iraq was immediately availalbe online, as well as that the Twin Towers of New York were destroyed on September 11, 2001. However, we just cannot  carry TV 24/7.

The Internet is a  convinient way of getting information, as long as your mobile phone is connected or you possess a laptop. When I am on a vehicle, I usually have my cellphone connected to the Internet, then browse through whathappend in the past few hours, or log in MSN to begin a conversation with my friends. Reading a newspaper is also a good way to kill time, but for me, a youngster, it is not so modern as “surfing online while commuting”.

The traditional media will never disappear, though the Internet has taken a big advantage  in the competition. And definitely, there is still a long way for the Internet to go. Anyway, the Internet benefits me the most, and I highly appreciate it.","[Fixed Criteria]

    ""You can get up-to-date news from the radio, TV and the Internet. Which kind of media do you think is the best to get the news?""

    [Essay]
    ""Nowadays, there are several channels to get news, such as the radio, TV, newspapers and the Internet. I think the Internet is the best among these.  In my essay, I am going to explain why.

Since its invention, the Internet has been booming as a prospective industry. Not only because it is a combination of text, audio and video, but also due to its convinience. It has threatened the domination of spreading news of the traditional media, and, I would say, is about to take control.

We can find everything we want on the Internet – the latest news, books, songs, movies, cartoons…  whatever. With the radio, we can merely hear. Compared to a newspaper, the radio and TV can provide the latest information. For instance the breaking news of the Americans’ attacking Iraq was immediately availalbe online, as well as that the Twin Towers of New York were destroyed on September 11, 2001. However, we just cannot  carry TV 24/7.

The Internet is a  convinient way of getting information, as long as your mobile phone is connected or you possess a laptop. When I am on a vehicle, I usually have my cellphone connected to the Internet, then browse through whathappend in the past few hours, or log in MSN to begin a conversation with my friends. Reading a newspaper is also a good way to kill time, but for me, a youngster, it is not so modern as “surfing online while commuting”.

The traditional media will never disappear, though the Internet has taken a big advantage  in the competition. And definitely, there is still a long way for the Internet to go. Anyway, the Internet benefits me the most, and I highly appreciate it.""
    
            [Task]
            You are an IELTS examiner, and you are required to evaluate an IELTS academic essay based on four specific criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. Each criterion should be rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 represents the highest level of proficiency and 1 the lowest.
            The detailed criteria is the text till the tag [Topic]. The essay topic is the text between [Topic] and the tag [Essay]. The essay that you need to evaluate is the text between the tag [Essay] and the tag [Task]. 
            
            ""Task Response"" evaluates how well the candidate fully answers the question and develops his or her ideas. Responses must be a minimum of 250 words. If the essay has 200-250 words, you should subtract 1 point from the Task Response score you would like to give to the student. If the essay has 20-200 words - subtract 2 points. If the essay has fewer than 20 words, you should assign a score of 1 for all criteria. If the essay is totally off-topic, you should assign a 2 to this criterion.
            ""Coherence and Cohesion"" evaluates the overall clarity and fluency of the message: how the response organizes and links information, ideas, and language. Coherence refers to the logical sequencing of ideas, while cohesion refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (for example, logical connectors, pronouns, and conjunctions) to clarify conceptual and referential relationships between and within sentences.
            ""Lexical Resource"" refers to the range of vocabulary the candidate has used, as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of that use in relation to the specific task. Academic style is welcomed, you should subtract 2 points if the essay is not academic. 
            ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy refers to the variety and accuracy of the candidate's grammar, including the use of punctuation.
            
            You will provide detailed feedback and scores for each criterion, scores are a must have. The feedback must include evidence from the original essay and reference the grading criteria to support your ideas.
            
            The output format should include:
            • ""Task Response feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes word count, overall correspondence between topic and essay, and unity of ideas in each paragraph. If the essay is off-topic, you should point this out with evidence.  
            • ""Coherence and Cohesion feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes use of linking words and number of paragraphs. Appropriate use of linking words and substitutions should be rewarded. The desired number of paragraphs is between 3 and 10. Essays that do not follow this structure should be penalized. 
            • ""Lexical Resource feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes number and example of B2, C1, C2 words based on CEFR complexity, noticeable word repetition, spelling mistakes. Appropriate and more complicated words will be rewarded; inappropriate word choice, oral style, and noticeable word repetition will be penalized. Spelling errors should be corrected. 
            • ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes grammar concepts used, grammar errors, use of complex sentences, including B2, C1, C2 sentences based on CEFR complexity, clauses, sentence length, punctuation errors. Complex sentences and the variety of grammatical resources used should be rewarded. Grammar and punctuation errors should be penalized and corrected.
            
            Based on the [Fixed Criteria] provided earlier and the feedback for each criterion, you are required to assign scores in the following format:
            • ""Task Response score"": An integer score from 1 to 9.

"In many countries  children are engaged in some kind of paid work. Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it to be a valuable work experience, which is important for learning and taking responsibility. What is your opinion on this?","In the Third World, children are usually sent to factories for laborious work. Many people believe that it is merely exploitation, while others think it is a good opportunity for them to have life experience. In any case, children have their right to live and study in peaceful conditions. Therefore, using them as workforce is considered an unacceptable action.

First of all, children are not workers. They have just learned about the vast world and do not have any experience or concept of working. Since these innocent children are naive and lack of life experiences, they can be easily cheated and exploited. There are many examples of this in poor nations. Because using children is cheap and easily to control, many enterprises hire them and don’t pay them much. Although the government in these countries has tried its best, this kind of taking advantage of children cannot be eliminated.

Moreover, children do not need such thing  as ‘valuable work experience’ that is supposedly ‘important for learning and taking responsibility’. The brief responsibility of children is learning. They are not old enough to understand what working experiences are. Nevertheless, they can help parents do chores or housework. This will be a much better way for them to become more responsible for family. In addition, childhood is one of the most remarkable memories and must not be taken away by forcing them to work.

In conclusion, since all children are the great concern of parent and society, they should be allowed to enjoy life and educated rather than encouraging them to work. Hence, one must ponder what view is actually appropriate for the sake of the children.","[Fixed Criteria]

            [Task]
            You are an IELTS examiner, and you are required to evaluate an IELTS academic essay based on four specific criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. Each criterion should be rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 represents the highest level of proficiency and 1 the lowest.
            The detailed criteria is the text till the tag [Topic]. The essay topic is the text between [Topic] and the tag [Essay]. The essay that you need to evaluate is the text between the tag [Essay] and the tag [Task]. 
            
            ""Task Response"" evaluates how well the candidate fully answers the question and develops his or her ideas. Responses must be a minimum of 250 words. If the essay has 200-250 words, you should subtract 1 point from the Task Response score you would like to give to the student. If the essay has 20-200 words - subtract 2 points. If the essay has fewer than 20 words, you should assign a score of 1 for all criteria. If the essay is totally off-topic, you should assign a 2 to this criterion.
            ""Coherence and Cohesion"" evaluates the overall clarity and fluency of the message: how the response organizes and links information, ideas, and language. Coherence refers to the logical sequencing of ideas, while cohesion refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (for example, logical connectors, pronouns, and conjunctions) to clarify conceptual and referential relationships between and within sentences.
            ""Lexical Resource"" refers to the range of vocabulary the candidate has used, as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of that use in relation to the specific task. Academic style is welcomed, you should subtract 2 points if the essay is not academic. 
            ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy refers to the variety and accuracy of the candidate's grammar, including the use of punctuation.
            
            You will provide detailed feedback and scores for each criterion, scores are a must have. The feedback must include evidence from the original essay and reference the grading criteria to support your ideas.
            
            The output format should include:
            • ""Task Response feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes word count, overall correspondence between topic and essay, and unity of ideas in each paragraph. If the essay is off-topic, you should point this out with evidence.  
            • ""Coherence and Cohesion feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes use of linking words and number of paragraphs. Appropriate use of linking words and substitutions should be rewarded. The desired number of paragraphs is between 3 and 10. Essays that do not follow this structure should be penalized. 
            • ""Lexical Resource feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes number and example of B2, C1, C2 words based on CEFR complexity, noticeable word repetition, spelling mistakes. Appropriate and more complicated words will be rewarded; inappropriate word choice, oral style, and noticeable word repetition will be penalized. Spelling errors should be corrected. 
            • ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes grammar concepts used, grammar errors, use of complex sentences, including B2, C1, C2 sentences based on CEFR complexity, clauses, sentence length, punctuation errors. Complex sentences and the variety of grammatical resources used should be rewarded. Grammar and punctuation errors should be penalized and corrected.
            
            Based on the [Fixed Criteria] provided earlier and the feedback for each criterion, you are required to assign scores in the following format:
            • ""Task Response score"": An integer score from 1 to 9.      
            • ""Coherence and Cohesion score"": An integer score from 1 to 9.
            • ""Lexical Resource score"": An integer score from 1 to 9.
            • ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy score"": An integer score from 1 to 9.
            Remember, your feedback should be supported with quotes from the original essay. 
            
            The output should look like this and each key should strictly have the name demonstrated bellow: 
            ""Task Response feedback"": 2-5 sentences with all evidence, ""Coherence and Cohesion feedback"":  2-5 sentences with all evidence, ""Lexical Resource feedback"":  2-5 sentences with all evidence, ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy feedback"":  2-5 sentences with all evidence, ""Task Response score"": an integer, ""Coherence and Cohesion score"": an integer, ""Lexical Resource score"": an integer, ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy score"": an integer.

The best way to reduce the number of traffic accidents is to raise age limit for the younger drivers and to lower age limit for the aged ones.  Do you agree?,"With the rapid increase in the number of vehicles on the road together with hush and rush lifestyles of drivers today, traffic accidents seem to be escalating in our society.  Age of drivers contribute partly to number of traffic accidents but surely not as the main factor.

Those who agree with the statement would view young drivers assuming under 18 years old and older drivers to be reckless and therefore would be more prone to traffic accidents on the road.  Lack of experience, forgetfulness, carelessness and poor fitness condition may be reasons for limiting age of drivers.

On the other hand, I would think that age is only a small determinant and we need to look at more effective measure such as reducing number of vehicles on the road through car pool, implementing more stringent regulations on alcohol drink driving and possibly to revise on the standard of driving test for young and old drivers on the road. Many drivers who are stuck in traffic jams also have busy lifestyles and therefore tend to become very stressed or distracted on the road.  Thus I would think the government may have to look ways to improve road infrastructure and traffic jams to deter or reduce accidents on the road.

To sum up, age is only one of the many contributors for accidents but I do not agree that by lowering age for the elderly and raising age limit for the younger drivers is the best method.  As mentioned in my third paragraph, we need to look at other more effective measures which deal with the underlying problems in the society which lead to traffic accidents.","[Fixed Criteria]

            [Task]
            You are an IELTS examiner, and you are required to evaluate an IELTS academic essay based on four specific criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. Each criterion should be rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 represents the highest level of proficiency and 1 the lowest.
            The detailed criteria is the text till the tag [Topic]. The essay topic is the text between [Topic] and the tag [Essay]. The essay that you need to evaluate is the text between the tag [Essay] and the tag [Task]. 
            
            ""Task Response"" evaluates how well the candidate fully answers the question and develops his or her ideas. Responses must be a minimum of 250 words. If the essay has 200-250 words, you should subtract 1 point from the Task Response score you would like to give to the student. If the essay has 20-200 words - subtract 2 points. If the essay has fewer than 20 words, you should assign a score of 1 for all criteria. If the essay is totally off-topic, you should assign a 2 to this criterion.
            ""Coherence and Cohesion"" evaluates the overall clarity and fluency of the message: how the response organizes and links information, ideas, and language. Coherence refers to the logical sequencing of ideas, while cohesion refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (for example, logical connectors, pronouns, and conjunctions) to clarify conceptual and referential relationships between and within sentences.
            ""Lexical Resource"" refers to the range of vocabulary the candidate has used, as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of that use in relation to the specific task. Academic style is welcomed, you should subtract 2 points if the essay is not academic. 
            ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy refers to the variety and accuracy of the candidate's grammar, including the use of punctuation.

Full time university students spend most of the time studying. They should be doing other activities too. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Full time study in university is a great experience in life but in parallel to that students become inactive in other activities such as working for their pocket money, sports, participating in debates and socialization. People differ in their opinion if students must engaged in other things or stay concentrated on their studies only. The discussion will be presented below, followed by my opinion.

Some people say that mere studying does not product an overall youth for a country. This way, students only earn theoretical knowledge -- not practical. For instance, students can be intelligent during their studies but at the same time when they come in the market to work n, they fail and cannot develop their confidence and work as brilliantly as they were in university. Hence, the best approach for them need to be engaged here and there for practical experience.

On the other hand, others believe that building a better career is the foremost thing in today’s world. So, they are targeted to their studies and gain as much knowledge as they can. Furthermore, if they are diverted from their studies, they will not be able to make their target.

In my point of view, there must be blending of full time education and extra activities. It refreshes students’ minds and provides more energy to concentrate on it. Moreover, by this way, they will learn how to be mingled with other people in the society.

To summarize, it can be said that it is important to concentrate on study but on the other hand there must be something to keep them active and relaxed being involved in games, music, work and other extra activities.","[Fixed Criteria]

            ""Coherence and Cohesion"" evaluates the overall clarity and fluency of the message: how the response organizes and links information, ideas, and language. Coherence refers to the logical sequencing of ideas, while cohesion refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (for example, logical connectors, pronouns, and conjunctions) to clarify conceptual and referential relationships between and within sentences.
            ""Lexical Resource"" refers to the range of vocabulary the candidate has used, as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of that use in relation to the specific task. Academic style is welcomed, you should subtract 2 points if the essay is not academic. 
            ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy refers to the variety and accuracy of the candidate's grammar, including the use of punctuation.

Students from rural areas often find it difficult to access university education. Some people think that it should become easier for them to study at universities. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"Nowadays, it is acknowledged that students from suburban areas find it tough to receive higher education. Whether it should be made easier for them to access university education becomes an ongoing concern, which incurs a highly-charged debate.

Obviously, higher education opportunities bring about benefits to students in multiple ways. For example, to receive  higher education becomes increasingly important to senior high school graduates, partly becasue it determines if they have the competitive edge in the job market, and partly because it is seen as a guarantee of a certain level of the mental ability, from the computer literacy that is required by the most employers to the capacities of acquiring new knowledge the soonest possible which is valued by the most workplaces. With a university degree, students from rural areas will obtain a job easily, thereby bettering their living conditions and their family as well.

Higher education also, however, tend to impose a heavy burden on their families since the relenting rise in the tuition fees which are - increasingly beyond those families’ ability to afford. In addition, with the mounting evidence, a university degree is not always a guarantee of seizing a decent job; therefore, their living conditions are likely to worse off by not able to earn back their tuition fee after graduation. In this way, some people argue, students from rural areas are not well-advised to pursue a university degree. But I perceive their desire to further their education should not be disrespected and the government should subsidise them to receive higher education.

In conclusion, university education should be made fair to everyone, predicated only on their academic performance and mental abilities, rather than their financial capacities and the government should subsidise those students in need.","[Fixed Criteria]

            [Task]
            You are an IELTS examiner, and you are required to evaluate an IELTS academic essay based on four specific criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. Each criterion should be rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 represents the highest level of proficiency and 1 the lowest.
            The detailed criteria is the text till the tag [Topic]. The essay topic is the text between [Topic] and the tag [Essay]. The essay that you need to evaluate is the text between the tag [Essay] and the tag [Task]. 
            
            ""Task Response"" evaluates how well the candidate fully answers the question and develops his or her ideas. Responses must be a minimum of 250 words. If the essay has 200-250 words, you should subtract 1 point from the Task Response score you would like to give to the student. If the essay has 20-200 words - subtract 2 points. If the essay has fewer than 20 words, you should assign a score of 1 for all criteria. If the essay is totally off-topic, you should assign a 2 to this criterion.
            ""Coherence and Cohesion"" evaluates the overall clarity and fluency of the message: how the response organizes and links information, ideas, and language. Coherence refers to the logical sequencing of ideas, while cohesion refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (for example, logical connectors, pronouns, and conjunctions) to clarify conceptual and referential relationships between and within sentences.
            ""Lexical Resource"" refers to the range of vocabulary the candidate has used, as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of that use in relation to the specific task. Academic style is welcomed, you should subtract 2 points if the essay is not academic.

Popular events like the football world cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"The World Cup football match and the Olympics are held worldwide with great national support and expectations. As a fan of those competitions, I agree with the idea that sporting events can be necessary for international relations and national unity, but only partially, because such events can have unintended effects on relationships between countries.

First of all, the World Cup, Olympics and other international games work for easing tensions among different nations. For example, South and North Korea have football games regularly which give two nations a chance to understand each other deeply. In the mid 1990s, a hundreds of North Korean supporters came to South Korea with the footballers and they were very excited during the sporting events. Even if it sounds ridiculous, many South Koreans were quite surprised at that moment when North Koreans shouted and cried during the match. We all realized that they were very normal sports fans even though they were occasionally very secretive. Through the sports, two divided nations could reduce their political and ideological tensions and could feel the patriotic unity.
On the other hand, some sports matches can make international relations worse. For instance, football or baseball games between Korea and Japan are always big matches in two countries where full of tensions overflow. Sometimes, after the matches, the two rivals blame each other and their patriotic emotions explode in an aggressive way. Even much worse scenario is that the troubles caused by losing games affect the players directly.
In conclusion, I think that international sporting occasions can be one of the good ways to ease tensions or to release patriotism safely. However, I believe that games can not be the fundamental ways for the sound patriotism or peaceful international relations.","[Fixed Criteria]

    ""Popular events like the football world cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?""

    [Essay]
    ""The World Cup football match and the Olympics are held worldwide with great national support and expectations. As a fan of those competitions, I agree with the idea that sporting events can be necessary for international relations and national unity, but only partially, because such events can have unintended effects on relationships between countries.

First of all, the World Cup, Olympics and other international games work for easing tensions among different nations. For example, South and North Korea have football games regularly which give two nations a chance to understand each other deeply. In the mid 1990s, a hundreds of North Korean supporters came to South Korea with the footballers and they were very excited during the sporting events. Even if it sounds ridiculous, many South Koreans were quite surprised at that moment when North Koreans shouted and cried during the match. We all realized that they were very normal sports fans even though they were occasionally very secretive. Through the sports, two divided nations could reduce their political and ideological tensions and could feel the patriotic unity.
On the other hand, some sports matches can make international relations worse. For instance, football or baseball games between Korea and Japan are always big matches in two countries where full of tensions overflow. Sometimes, after the matches, the two rivals blame each other and their patriotic emotions explode in an aggressive way. Even much worse scenario is that the troubles caused by losing games affect the players directly.
In conclusion, I think that international sporting occasions can be one of the good ways to ease tensions or to release patriotism safely. However, I believe that games can not be the fundamental ways for the sound patriotism or peaceful international relations.""
    
            [Task]
            You are an IELTS examiner, and you are required to evaluate an IELTS academic essay based on four specific criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. Each criterion should be rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 represents the highest level of proficiency and 1 the lowest.
            The detailed criteria is the text till the tag [Topic]. The essay topic is the text between [Topic] and the tag [Essay]. The essay that you need to evaluate is the text between the tag [Essay] and the tag [Task]. 
            
            ""Task Response"" evaluates how well the candidate fully answers the question and develops his or her ideas. Responses must be a minimum of 250 words. If the essay has 200-250 words, you should subtract 1 point from the Task Response score you would like to give to the student. If the essay has 20-200 words - subtract 2 points. If the essay has fewer than 20 words, you should assign a score of 1 for all criteria. If the essay is totally off-topic, you should assign a 2 to this criterion.
            ""Coherence and Cohesion"" evaluates the overall clarity and fluency of the message: how the response organizes and links information, ideas, and language. Coherence refers to the logical sequencing of ideas, while cohesion refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (for example, logical connectors, pronouns, and conjunctions) to clarify conceptual and referential relationships between and within sentences.
            ""Lexical Resource"" refers to the range of vocabulary the candidate has used, as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of that use in relation to the specific task. Academic style is welcomed, you should subtract 2 points if the essay is not academic. 
            ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy refers to the variety and accuracy of the candidate's grammar, including the use of punctuation.
            
            You will provide detailed feedback and scores for each criterion, scores are a must have. The feedback must include evidence from the original essay and reference the grading criteria to support your ideas.
            
            The output format should include:
            • ""Task Response feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes word count, overall correspondence between topic and essay, and unity of ideas in each paragraph. If the essay is off-topic, you should point this out with evidence.  
            • ""Coherence and Cohesion feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes use of linking words and number of paragraphs. Appropriate use of linking words and substitutions should be rewarded. The desired number of paragraphs is between 3 and 10. Essays that do not follow this structure should be penalized. 
            • ""Lexical Resource feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes number and example of B2, C1, C2 words based on CEFR complexity, noticeable word repetition, spelling mistakes. Appropriate and more complicated words will be rewarded; inappropriate word choice, oral style, and noticeable word repetition will be penalized. Spelling errors should be corrected. 
            • ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes grammar concepts used, grammar errors, use of complex sentences, including B2, C1, C2 sentences based on CEFR complexity, clauses, sentence length, punctuation errors. Complex sentences and the variety of grammatical resources used should be rewarded. Grammar and punctuation errors should be penalized and corrected.
            
            Based on the [Fixed Criteria] provided earlier and the feedback for each criterion, you are required to assign scores in the following format:
            • ""Task Response score"": An integer score from 1 to 9.

            • ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy score"": An integer score from 1 to 9.
            Remember, your feedback should be supported with quotes from the original essay. 
            
            The output should look like this and each key should strictly have the name demonstrated bellow: 
            ""Task Response feedback"": 2-5 sentences with all evidence, ""Coherence and Cohesion feedback"":  2-5 sentences with all evidence, ""Lexical Resource feedback"":  2-5 sentences with all evidence, ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy feedback"":  2-5 sentences with all evidence, ""Task Response score"": an integer, ""Coherence and Cohesion score"": an integer, ""Lexical Resource score"": an integer, ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy score"": an integer.
            
            Please ensure that your output is formatted strictly in JSON, and it has 6 elements as shown above."
Some people say that the Internet is making the world smaller by bringing people together.

"With all the problems in the world today, spending money on space exploration is a complete waste. The money could be better spent on other causes.","First, until all urgent and important matters of the globe have been solved, money bumped  on space exploration is meaningless. It is not a common sense at all to invest millions of dollars researching and producing foods for astronauts (for space exploration purpose), while every day thousands of people are starving. Furthermore, the discovery of outer space only serves a minor group of people if the majority are even not well-educated. Those in rural areas or third-world nations do no even know how to prevent common threatening diseases such as AIDS and lung cancer.

Then, some may argue that the purpose of space exploration are to discover new lands, new energy resources or to deter potential threat to globe. Nevertheless, is it effective to do so while other alternatives are available? Lands on earth are no yet effectively used. New energy resources (e.g. solar and nuclear energy) have not yet been widely-used. Threats of plagues have not yet been deterred. All of these tasks that haven’t been tackled yet require money. That is why costly space discovery programs are a waste of resources.

In a nutshell, people should only invest in space exploration  provided that urgent and important matters mentioned earlier in this essay have been solved. Also, purposes of space exploration campaigns should be studied carefully and other alternatives should be considered before the money is wasted.","[Fixed Criteria]

    ""With all the problems in the world today, spending money on space exploration is a complete waste. The money could be better spent on other causes.""

    [Essay]
    ""First, until all urgent and important matters of the globe have been solved, money bumped  on space exploration is meaningless. It is not a common sense at all to invest millions of dollars researching and producing foods for astronauts (for space exploration purpose), while every day thousands of people are starving. Furthermore, the discovery of outer space only serves a minor group of people if the majority are even not well-educated. Those in rural areas or third-world nations do no even know how to prevent common threatening diseases such as AIDS and lung cancer.

Then, some may argue that the purpose of space exploration are to discover new lands, new energy resources or to deter potential threat to globe. Nevertheless, is it effective to do so while other alternatives are available? Lands on earth are no yet effectively used. New energy resources (e.g. solar and nuclear energy) have not yet been widely-used. Threats of plagues have not yet been deterred. All of these tasks that haven’t been tackled yet require money. That is why costly space discovery programs are a waste of resources.

In a nutshell, people should only invest in space exploration  provided that urgent and important matters mentioned earlier in this essay have been solved. Also, purposes of space exploration campaigns should be studied carefully and other alternatives should be considered before the money is wasted.""
    
            [Task]
            You are an IELTS examiner, and you are required to evaluate an IELTS academic essay based on four specific criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. Each criterion should be rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 represents the highest level of proficiency and 1 the lowest.
            The detailed criteria is the text till the tag [Topic]. The essay topic is the text between [Topic] and the tag [Essay]. The essay that you need to evaluate is the text between the tag [Essay] and the tag [Task]. 
            
            ""Task Response"" evaluates how well the candidate fully answers the question and develops his or her ideas. Responses must be a minimum of 250 words. If the essay has 200-250 words, you should subtract 1 point from the Task Response score you would like to give to the student. If the essay has 20-200 words - subtract 2 points. If the essay has fewer than 20 words, you should assign a score of 1 for all criteria. If the essay is totally off-topic, you should assign a 2 to this criterion.
            ""Coherence and Cohesion"" evaluates the overall clarity and fluency of the message: how the response organizes and links information, ideas, and language. Coherence refers to the logical sequencing of ideas, while cohesion refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (for example, logical connectors, pronouns, and conjunctions) to clarify conceptual and referential relationships between and within sentences.
            ""Lexical Resource"" refers to the range of vocabulary the candidate has used, as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of that use in relation to the specific task. Academic style is welcomed, you should subtract 2 points if the essay is not academic. 
            ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy refers to the variety and accuracy of the candidate's grammar, including the use of punctuation.
            
            You will provide detailed feedback and scores for each criterion, scores are a must have. The feedback must include evidence from the original essay and reference the grading criteria to support your ideas.
            
            The output format should include:
            • ""Task Response feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes word count, overall correspondence between topic and essay, and unity of ideas in each paragraph. If the essay is off-topic, you should point this out with evidence.  
            • ""Coherence and Cohesion feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes use of linking words and number of paragraphs. Appropriate use of linking words and substitutions should be rewarded. The desired number of paragraphs is between 3 and 10. Essays that do not follow this structure should be penalized. 
            • ""Lexical Resource feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes number and example of B2, C1, C2 words based on CEFR complexity, noticeable word repetition, spelling mistakes. Appropriate and more complicated words will be rewarded; inappropriate word choice, oral style, and noticeable word repetition will be penalized. Spelling errors should be corrected. 
            • ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes grammar concepts used, grammar errors, use of complex sentences, including B2, C1, C2 sentences based on CEFR complexity, clauses, sentence length, punctuation errors. Complex sentences and the variety of grammatical resources used should be rewarded. Grammar and punctuation errors should be penalized and corrected.
            
            Based on the [Fixed Criteria] provided earlier and the feedback for each criterion, you are required to assign scores in the following format:
            • ""Task Response score"": An integer score from 1 to 9.      
            • ""Coherence and Cohesion score"": An integer score from 1 to 9.
            • ""Lexical Resource score"": An integer score from 1 to 9.
            • ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy score"": An integer score from 1 to 9.
            Remember, your feedback should be supported with quotes from the original essay. 
            
            The output should look like this and each key should strictly have the name demonstrated bellow: 
            ""Task Response feedback"": 2-5 sentences with all evidence, ""Coherence and Cohesion feedback"":  2-5 sentences with all evidence, ""Lexical Resource feedback"":  2-5 sentences with all evidence, ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy feedback"":  2-5 sentences with all evidence, ""Task Response score"": an integer, ""Coherence and Cohesion score"": an integer, ""Lexical Resource score"": an integer, ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy score"": an integer.

"In some countries children have very strict rules of behavior, in other countries they are allowed to do almost anything they like.

Some people think that there should have  some strict rules of behavior for children, but I disagree with this statement.

Wherever it is a reality that sometimes more restrictions can cause more frustration in children, which leads to many other mental problems as well. Morever they can be, behave like a stubborn. Sometimes they feel themselves under pressure, which can be the main reason for their poor performance in their field.

Moreover_  if we never draw attention upon  the children’s main activities then they might end up in a bad company. They can know regarding the value of respect for their elders. They can know the  importance of relationships. They can know regarding their cultural values as well.

Some businesses prohibit smoking in any of their offices. Some governments have banned smoking in all public places. Do you agree or disagree that this is the right course of action? Give reasons for your opinion.,"Allow me to present the three positive sides of smoking. Firstly, smoking certainly helps many people to relax. For some, it even improves concentration. If someone is upset owing to debt or they have  exam,  like  to  smoke to reduce the pressure or tension. Most of the people like to smoke when they are relaxing with friends.  Secondly, governments throughout the world make huge profits from taxes on cigarettes. The income obtained through taxes provides funds which are used for building school, hospital and public places such as parks, gardens, sports ground and foot paths. Thirdly, tobacco industry also employs tens of thousands of people all over the world, particularly in poorer countries such as Zimbabwe or the Philippines. Without cigarettes, these people would have no jobs.

Despite these positive effects there are lots of negative effects to smoking too.  Initially,  smoking has been proven to be very dangerous for health. As one cigarette contains more than 4000 chemical substances, therefore, it causes for many dangerous diseases such as heart attacks, asthma, bronchitis or lung cancer.  According to a recent report in Britain  close to 3,500 people are killed each year in road accidents and 120,000 are killed by smoking. Furthermore,  smoking costs governments millions of dollars because of the large number of people who need treatment in hospitals for smoking-related problems.  Moreover,  passive smoking is also a major concern today. Recent research shows that non-smokers can suffer from health problems if they spend long periods of time among people who do smoke. In the UK children whose parents are smoke are three times as likely to start smoking themselves _.

In short, I think the world would be a better place without cigarettes. However, the decision of whether _  smoke or not to smoke should be for each individual to make. I suggest that people should not smoke in a room or a place where there are non smokers,  however they should be free to smoke elsewhere.","[Fixed Criteria]

    ""Some businesses prohibit smoking in any of their offices. Some governments have banned smoking in all public places. Do you agree or disagree that this is the right course of action? Give reasons for your opinion.""

    [Essay]
    ""Allow me to present the three positive sides of smoking. Firstly, smoking certainly helps many people to relax. For some, it even improves concentration. If someone is upset owing to debt or they have  exam,  like  to  smoke to reduce the pressure or tension. Most of the people like to smoke when they are relaxing with friends.  Secondly, governments throughout the world make huge profits from taxes on cigarettes. The income obtained through taxes provides funds which are used for building school, hospital and public places such as parks, gardens, sports ground and foot paths. Thirdly, tobacco industry also employs tens of thousands of people all over the world, particularly in poorer countries such as Zimbabwe or the Philippines. Without cigarettes, these people would have no jobs.

Despite these positive effects there are lots of negative effects to smoking too.  Initially,  smoking has been proven to be very dangerous for health. As one cigarette contains more than 4000 chemical substances, therefore, it causes for many dangerous diseases such as heart attacks, asthma, bronchitis or lung cancer.  According to a recent report in Britain  close to 3,500 people are killed each year in road accidents and 120,000 are killed by smoking. Furthermore,  smoking costs governments millions of dollars because of the large number of people who need treatment in hospitals for smoking-related problems.  Moreover,  passive smoking is also a major concern today. Recent research shows that non-smokers can suffer from health problems if they spend long periods of time among people who do smoke. In the UK children whose parents are smoke are three times as likely to start smoking themselves _.

In short, I think the world would be a better place without cigarettes. However, the decision of whether _  smoke or not to smoke should be for each individual to make. I suggest that people should not smoke in a room or a place where there are non smokers,  however they should be free to smoke elsewhere.""
    
            [Task]
            You are an IELTS examiner, and you are required to evaluate an IELTS academic essay based on four specific criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. Each criterion should be rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 represents the highest level of proficiency and 1 the lowest.
            The detailed criteria is the text till the tag [Topic]. The essay topic is the text between [Topic] and the tag [Essay]. The essay that you need to evaluate is the text between the tag [Essay] and the tag [Task]. 
            
            ""Task Response"" evaluates how well the candidate fully answers the question and develops his or her ideas. Responses must be a minimum of 250 words. If the essay has 200-250 words, you should subtract 1 point from the Task Response score you would like to give to the student. If the essay has 20-200 words - subtract 2 points.

            ""Coherence and Cohesion"" evaluates the overall clarity and fluency of the message: how the response organizes and links information, ideas, and language. Coherence refers to the logical sequencing of ideas, while cohesion refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (for example, logical connectors, pronouns, and conjunctions) to clarify conceptual and referential relationships between and within sentences.
            ""Lexical Resource"" refers to the range of vocabulary the candidate has used, as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of that use in relation to the specific task. Academic style is welcomed, you should subtract 2 points if the essay is not academic. 
            ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy refers to the variety and accuracy of the candidate's grammar, including the use of punctuation.

Evidence includes number and example of B2, C1, C2 words based on CEFR complexity, noticeable word repetition, spelling mistakes. Appropriate and more complicated words will be rewarded; inappropriate word choice, oral style, and noticeable word repetition will be penalized. Spelling errors should be corrected. 
            • ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes grammar concepts used, grammar errors, use of complex sentences, including B2, C1, C2 sentences based on CEFR complexity, clauses, sentence length, punctuation errors. Complex sentences and the variety of grammatical resources used should be rewarded. Grammar and punctuation errors should be penalized and corrected.
            
            Based on the [Fixed Criteria] provided earlier and the feedback for each criterion, you are required to assign scores in the following format:

"Advertising is all around us, it is an unavoidable part of everyone’s life. Some people say that advertising is a positive part of our lives while others say it is a negative one.

However, others said it has been playing as positive effect on this world. This is not an easy essay to be answered, but I will look at this issue.

Why advertisement has been playing a negative effect in our life ? Of Course for several reasons: firstly, it motivates the psychological point in everyone, and women in particular. They will run to buy this advertised product especially if it’s from cosmetic roof, just to show their beauty to men, which may lead to negative effects of too much sexual attention. Secondly, you can sit comfortably with your family and suddenly the telephone is ringing, but it’s nothing important, it’s just another company try to convince you to buy one of their products. It is a real intrusive example of advertisement. Lastly, sometimes you do not have the financial ability to buy something, but with these new methods of advertisement, you will run to buy it, which will affect your budget.

On the other hand, there are some good sides to advertising. For instance, it compares the prices of many companies which benefit the consumer. Besides, it really opens our vision to see more products which we do not knowit unless the TV or Radio advertised them. In addition to, it breaks our daily routine and allows us to see new faces and learn the language better with the help of the daily updates they deliver through advertisement.

In conclusion, as we can see there are many aspects to this essay. I feel that we gain no benefits at all from advertisement, it plays on minds of people  buy more things that they do not need it at all.","[Fixed Criteria]

News editors decide what to broadcast on television and what to print in a newspaper. What factors do you think influence their decisions? Do we become used to bad news? Would it be better if more good news was reported?,"The second factor is how hot and attractive the news is. Who will reads or watch news from a year or a month ago or even about something that happened last week? The answer is nobody absolutely. In the energetic and competitive world nowadays, people always ask for a really new news. So that to satisfy customers, there is a pressure on all editors to find continually what has already happened not only yesterday but even an hour ago. Or else, they may lose their customers. None of editors wants that bleak future.

The type of news is also an important consideration. Whether on television or in newspapers, we seem to get more of and become used to bad news. It is harder for us to come across a piece of good news. We can’t deny that bad things happen on Earth day by day. However, news editors try to gain more and more customer, which means more and more money, using bad news as a magnet. Because bad news makes us curious. We want to know why it is bad, what it is about, whether it influences us or not. As a result, we will buy newspapers or watch television to find out. And the happiest people are, of course, news editors.

In my view it would be better if more good news were reported. Bad news makes us worry and sad. Whereas good news makes us happy. There should an an equal amount of good and bad news. In that way we can give something bad a lot of thought while still being happy about the good news. Any inequalities between good news and bad news should be avoided. Nowadays we cannot live without news, and for that reason the role of news editors became very important. We should support them, and in turn they should try their best to provide us with useful news, both good and bad.","[Fixed Criteria]

    [Topic]
    ""News editors decide what to broadcast on television and what to print in a newspaper. What factors do you think influence their decisions? Do we become used to bad news? Would it be better if more good news was reported?""

    [Essay]
    ""The second factor is how hot and attractive the news is. Who will reads or watch news from a year or a month ago or even about something that happened last week? The answer is nobody absolutely. In the energetic and competitive world nowadays, people always ask for a really new news. So that to satisfy customers, there is a pressure on all editors to find continually what has already happened not only yesterday but even an hour ago. Or else, they may lose their customers. None of editors wants that bleak future.

The type of news is also an important consideration. Whether on television or in newspapers, we seem to get more of and become used to bad news. It is harder for us to come across a piece of good news. We can’t deny that bad things happen on Earth day by day. However, news editors try to gain more and more customer, which means more and more money, using bad news as a magnet. Because bad news makes us curious. We want to know why it is bad, what it is about, whether it influences us or not. As a result, we will buy newspapers or watch television to find out. And the happiest people are, of course, news editors.

In my view it would be better if more good news were reported. Bad news makes us worry and sad. Whereas good news makes us happy. There should an an equal amount of good and bad news. In that way we can give something bad a lot of thought while still being happy about the good news. Any inequalities between good news and bad news should be avoided. Nowadays we cannot live without news, and for that reason the role of news editors became very important. We should support them, and in turn they should try their best to provide us with useful news, both good and bad.""
    
            [Task]
            You are an IELTS examiner, and you are required to evaluate an IELTS academic essay based on four specific criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. Each criterion should be rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 represents the highest level of proficiency and 1 the lowest.
            The detailed criteria is the text till the tag [Topic]. The essay topic is the text between [Topic] and the tag [Essay]. The essay that you need to evaluate is the text between the tag [Essay] and the tag [Task]. 
            
            ""Task Response"" evaluates how well the candidate fully answers the question and develops his or her ideas. Responses must be a minimum of 250 words. If the essay has 200-250 words, you should subtract 1 point from the Task Response score you would like to give to the student. If the essay has 20-200 words - subtract 2 points. If the essay has fewer than 20 words, you should assign a score of 1 for all criteria. If the essay is totally off-topic, you should assign a 2 to this criterion.
            ""Coherence and Cohesion"" evaluates the overall clarity and fluency of the message: how the response organizes and links information, ideas, and language. Coherence refers to the logical sequencing of ideas, while cohesion refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (for example, logical connectors, pronouns, and conjunctions) to clarify conceptual and referential relationships between and within sentences.
            ""Lexical Resource"" refers to the range of vocabulary the candidate has used, as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of that use in relation to the specific task. Academic style is welcomed, you should subtract 2 points if the essay is not academic. 
            ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy refers to the variety and accuracy of the candidate's grammar, including the use of punctuation.
            
            You will provide detailed feedback and scores for each criterion, scores are a must have. The feedback must include evidence from the original essay and reference the grading criteria to support your ideas.
            
            The output format should include:
            • ""Task Response feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes word count, overall correspondence between topic and essay, and unity of ideas in each paragraph. If the essay is off-topic, you should point this out with evidence.  
            • ""Coherence and Cohesion feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes use of linking words and number of paragraphs. Appropriate use of linking words and substitutions should be rewarded. The desired number of paragraphs is between 3 and 10. Essays that do not follow this structure should be penalized. 
            • ""Lexical Resource feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes number and example of B2, C1, C2 words based on CEFR complexity, noticeable word repetition, spelling mistakes. Appropriate and more complicated words will be rewarded; inappropriate word choice, oral style, and noticeable word repetition will be penalized. Spelling errors should be corrected. 
            • ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes grammar concepts used, grammar errors, use of complex sentences, including B2, C1, C2 sentences based on CEFR complexity, clauses, sentence length, punctuation errors. Complex sentences and the variety of grammatical resources used should be rewarded. Grammar and punctuation errors should be penalized and corrected.
            
            Based on the [Fixed Criteria] provided earlier and the feedback for each criterion, you are required to assign scores in the following format:
            • ""Task Response score"": An integer score from 1 to 9.      
            • ""Coherence and Cohesion score"": An integer score from 1 to 9.
            • ""Lexical Resource score"": An integer score from 1 to 9.
            • ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy score"": An integer score from 1 to 9.
            Remember, your feedback should be supported with quotes from the original essay. 
            
            The output should look like this and each key should strictly have the name demonstrated bellow: 
            ""Task Response feedback"": 2-5 sentences with all evidence, ""Coherence and Cohesion feedback"":  2-5 sentences with all evidence, ""Lexical Resource feedback"":  2-5 sentences with all evidence, ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy feedback"":  2-5 sentences with all evidence, ""Task Response score"": an integer, ""Coherence and Cohesion score"": an integer, ""Lexical Resource score"": an integer, ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy score"": an integer.
            
            Please ensure that your output is formatted strictly in JSON, and it has 6 elements as shown above."

Some people say that protecting the environment is the government’s responsibility. Others believe that every individual should be responsible for it. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"People hold different views about whether the government should shoulder the responsibility of preserving the environment or each person is responsible one. From my standpoint, it will be more beneficial if both the country’s authorities and individuals share the responsibility.

On the one hand, the government may play a pivotal role in maintaining the environment safe and healthy. It is authorities that should introduce the legislation in order to mitigate environmental problems, such as air pollution and more. To illustrate, there should be some laws encouraging factories to move to the country sides rather than staying in cities. This could help urban areas to be further protected from the poisonous fumes, which are always discharged from firms. Another prominent role the government could play would be creating TV programs to educate citizens, and to persuade them to care the nature more. Being informed of the consequences of their activities, individuals may endeavor to alter their ways, to avoid harming the environment.

On the other hand, it is undeniable that each person can play an important role in protecting their own neighborhood. Cars are considered to be a major source of air pollution. Their exhaust gases contaminate the air, ranging from carbon dioxide to unburnt carbon. Therefore, by using their own vehicles only in rare cases, people would be able to protect the environment. Another opportunity available to individuals is recycling. By stopping plastic waste from entering and contaminating waterways people are able to conserve drinkable water and its inhabitants.

In conclusion, due to the large amount of work involved, mobilising all the possible forces is a more sensible approach. It is, therefore, likely that joint efforts of both the governments and their citizens would result in the most effective way of preserving the environment.","[Fixed Criteria]

"Many offenders commit more crimes after serving the first punishment. Why is this happening, and what measures can be taken to tackle this problem?","It is true that some criminals commit crimes again after they have been punished. While there are several reasons for this alarming trend, some effective measures can be taken by governments to tackle this problem.

There are two main reasons for re-offenders. Firstly, the prison system can make the situation worse. Criminals put together in prison and they make friends with other offenders. While they are locked up in prison, they do not have much to do there, and they would exchange information about what they have done before they came to the prison or they may plan crimes with other inmates. Secondly, offenders often do not have any other means of earning money. They are poor, uneducated and lacking skills needed to maintain a job. Also, a criminal record makes finding a job difficult as people usually avoid hiring ex-convict.

To solve this problem, governments should focus on rehabilitation of criminals rather than punishment. Above all, prisons need vocational training which makes inmates to prepare for life outside the prison. They can learn practical skills such as computer programming, car maintenance and graphic design. In this way, they can be hired for a position that requires this certain knowledge and skills. Community service is another way to reform offenders. Rather than being locked up in prison with other inmates, offenders can help society and become useful to their local community, and these activities would eliminate the negative influence that prisons can have.

In conclusion, it is true the re-offenders are one of the problems in our community; it can be solved by focusing rehabilitation rather than punishment itself.","[Fixed Criteria]

            ""Lexical Resource"" refers to the range of vocabulary the candidate has used, as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of that use in relation to the specific task. Academic style is welcomed, you should subtract 2 points if the essay is not academic. 
            ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy refers to the variety and accuracy of the candidate's grammar, including the use of punctuation.
            
            You will provide detailed feedback and scores for each criterion, scores are a must have. The feedback must include evidence from the original essay and reference the grading criteria to support your ideas.
            
            The output format should include:
            • ""Task Response feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes word count, overall correspondence between topic and essay, and unity of ideas in each paragraph. If the essay is off-topic, you should point this out with evidence.  
            • ""Coherence and Cohesion feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes use of linking words and number of paragraphs. Appropriate use of linking words and substitutions should be rewarded. The desired number of paragraphs is between 3 and 10. Essays that do not follow this structure should be penalized. 
            • ""Lexical Resource feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes number and example of B2, C1, C2 words based on CEFR complexity, noticeable word repetition, spelling mistakes. Appropriate and more complicated words will be rewarded; inappropriate word choice, oral style, and noticeable word repetition will be penalized. Spelling errors should be corrected. 
            • ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes grammar concepts used, grammar errors, use of complex sentences, including B2, C1, C2 sentences based on CEFR complexity, clauses, sentence length, punctuation errors. Complex sentences and the variety of grammatical resources used should be rewarded. Grammar and punctuation errors should be penalized and corrected.
            
            Based on the [Fixed Criteria] provided earlier and the feedback for each criterion, you are required to assign scores in the following format:

"As computers are being used more and more in education, there will be soon no role for teachers in the classroom. Do you agree or disagree?","There is no doubt that education and the process of learning has changed since the introduction of computers. The search for information has become easier and more entertaining, and connectivity has expedited the availability of data. Though  experts systems have made computers more intelligent, they have not yet become a substitute for the human interaction in the learning process. In my opinion, what can be expected is a change in the teachers’ role, but not their disappearance from the classroom.

Nobody can argue with the fact that the acquisition of knowledge is more fun and easier with computers. The mere activity of touching and exploring this device constitutes an enjoyable task for a child. This, accompanied by a relaxing attitude and interactivity of software, usually contributes to a better grasping of new knowledge. At a higher educational level the availability of digital books, simulators and other academic materials provides the student with an ever accessible source of information, that otherwise would not be at hand.

But, besides the increasing complexity and behavior of intelligent software, which is usually embedded in the academic digital material, the need for human interaction in the learning process will always be present, at least in the foreseeable future. There is the necessity for a human being to be able to determine what the  specifics needs of each individual are. The expertise of a teacher in how to explain and adapt complex concepts to different individuals can hardly be mimicked by a computer, no matter how sophisticated its software is.

As computers are becoming a common tool for teaching, teachers should be more aware of their role as guides in the acquisition of knowledge rather than transmitters of facts. They have to be receptive to the changes that are taking places, keep updated and serve as problem solvers in the learning process, thus allowing students to discover the fact for themselves.

To summarize, in my personal view, teachers play and will continue to play an important role in the classroom, especially at the primary school level. No matter how capable computers become, there will be no replacement for human interaction, but in the way haw this interaction takes place.","[Fixed Criteria]

- 7 means ""The main parts of the prompt are appropriately addressed. A clear and developed position is presented. Main ideas are extended and supported but there may be a tendency to over-generalise or there may be a lack of focus and precision in supporting ideas/material.""
- 6 means ""The main parts of the prompt are addressed (though some may be more fully covered than others). An appropriate format is used. A position is presented that is directly relevant to the prompt, although the conclusions drawn may be unclear, unjustified or repetitive.

- 5 means ""The main parts of the prompt are incompletely addressed. The format may be inappropriate in places. The writer expresses a position, but the development is not always clear. Some main ideas are put forward, but they are limited and are not sufficiently developed and/or there may be irrelevant detail. There may be some repetition."" A
- 4 means ""The prompt is tackled in a minimal way, or the answer is tangential, possibly due to some misunderstanding of the prompt. The format may be inappropriate. A position is discernible, but the reader has to read carefully to find it. Main ideas are difficult to identify and such ideas that are identifiable may lack relevance, clarity and/or support. Large parts of the response may be repetitive.""
- 3 means ""No part of the prompt is adequately addressed, or the prompt has been misunderstood. No relevant position can be identified, and/or there is little direct response to the question/s. There are few ideas, and these may be irrelevant or insufficiently developed.""
- 2 means ""The content is barely related to the prompt. No position can be identified. There may be glimpses of one or two ideas without development.""
- 1 means ""Responses of 20 words or fewer are rated at Band 1. The content is wholly unrelated to the prompt.""
For ""Coherence and Cohesion"":
- 9 (the highest band) means ""The message can be followed effortlessly. Cohesion is used in such a way that it very rarely attracts attention. Any lapses in coherence or cohesion are minimal. Paragraphing is skilfully managed.
- 8 means ""The message can be followed with ease. Information and ideas are logically sequenced, and cohesion is well managed. Occasional lapses in coherence or cohesion may occur. Paragraphing is used sufficiently and appropriately.""
- 7 means ""Information and ideas are logically organised and there is a clear progression throughout the response. A few lapses may occur. A range of cohesive devices including reference and substitution is used flexibly but with some inaccuracies or some over/under use""
- 6 means ""Information and ideas are generally arranged coherently and there is a clear overall progression. Cohesive devices are used to some good effect but cohesion within and/or between sentences may be faulty or mechanical due to misuse, overuse or omission. The use of reference and substitution may lack flexibility or clarity and result in some repetition or error.
- 5 means ""Organisation is evident but is not wholly logical and there may be a lack of overall progression. Nevertheless, there is a sense of underlying coherence to the response. The relationship of ideas can be followed but the sentences are not fluently linked to each other. There may be limited/overuse of cohesive devices with some inaccuracy. The writing may be repetitive due to inadequate and/or inaccurate use of reference and substitution.""
- 4 means ""Information and ideas are evident but not arranged coherently, and there is no clear progression within the response. Relationships between ideas can be unclear and/or inadequately marked. There is some use of basic cohesive devices, which may be inaccurate or repetitive. There is inaccurate use or a lack of substitution or referencing.""
- 3 means ""There is no apparent logical organisation. Ideas are discernible but difficult to relate to each other. Minimal use of sequencers or cohesive devices. Those used do not necessarily indicate a logical relationship between ideas. There is difficulty in identifying referencing.""
- 2 means ""There is little relevant message, or the entire response may be off-topic. There is little evidence of control of organisational features.""
- 1 means ""Responses of 20 words or fewer are rated at Band 1. The writing fails to communicate any message and appears to be by a virtual non-writer.""
For ""Lexical Resource"":
- 9 (the highest score) means ""Full flexibility and precise use are evident within the scope of the task. A wide range of vocabulary is used accurately and appropriately with very natural and sophisticated control of lexical features. Minor errors in spelling and word formation are extremely rare and have minimal impact on communication.""
- 8 means ""A wide resource is fluently and flexibly used to convey precise meanings within the scope of the task. There is skilful use of uncommon and/or 
idiomatic items when appropriate, despite occasional inaccuracies in word choice and collocation. Occasional errors in spelling and/or word formation may occur, but have minimal impact on communication.""
- 7 means ""The resource is sufficient to allow some flexibility and precision. There is some ability to use less common and/or idiomatic items. An awareness of style and collocation is evident, though inappropriacies occur. There are only a few errors in spelling and/or word formation, and they do not detract from overall clarity"".
- 6 means ""The resource is generally adequate and appropriate for the task. The meaning is generally clear in spite of a rather restricted range or a lack of precision in word choice. If the writer is a risk-taker, there will be a wider range of vocabulary used but higher degrees of inaccuracy or inappropriacy.There are some errors in spelling and/or word formation, but these do not impede communication.""
- 5 means ""The resource is limited but minimally adequate for the task. Simple vocabulary may be used accurately but the range does not permit much variation in expression. There may be frequent lapses in the appropriacy of word choice, and a lack of flexibility is apparent in frequent simplifications and/or repetitions.

            [Task]
            You are an IELTS examiner, and you are required to evaluate an IELTS academic essay based on four specific criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. Each criterion should be rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 represents the highest level of proficiency and 1 the lowest.
            The detailed criteria is the text till the tag [Topic]. The essay topic is the text between [Topic] and the tag [Essay]. The essay that you need to evaluate is the text between the tag [Essay] and the tag [Task]. 
            
            ""Task Response"" evaluates how well the candidate fully answers the question and develops his or her ideas. Responses must be a minimum of 250 words. If the essay has 200-250 words, you should subtract 1 point from the Task Response score you would like to give to the student. If the essay has 20-200 words - subtract 2 points. If the essay has fewer than 20 words, you should assign a score of 1 for all criteria. If the essay is totally off-topic, you should assign a 2 to this criterion.
            ""Coherence and Cohesion"" evaluates the overall clarity and fluency of the message: how the response organizes and links information, ideas, and language. Coherence refers to the logical sequencing of ideas, while cohesion refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (for example, logical connectors, pronouns, and conjunctions) to clarify conceptual and referential relationships between and within sentences.
            ""Lexical Resource"" refers to the range of vocabulary the candidate has used, as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of that use in relation to the specific task. Academic style is welcomed, you should subtract 2 points if the essay is not academic. 
            ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy refers to the variety and accuracy of the candidate's grammar, including the use of punctuation.

Financial education should be a mandatory component of the school program. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"It is an obvious fact that financial aspects are a major part of the daily life, as an adult and even as a young individual. Each and every one of us has to make financial decisions concerning recreation, health, education and more. The question is whether to start with financial education as part of school program or to postpone it for a later stage in life.

To begin with, being able to understand the value of money, the way the economic system works and to interpret financial news and its implications is a virtue. Without this virtue, an individual, even a young one, might suffer to some extent. For an example, a child who doesn’t understand the concept of money might find it more difficult to except choosing only one present out of more possible ones.In addition, many adults are lacking capability of financial analysis. Quite often, the reason can be the lack of sound foundations or insecurity when it comes to financial terms and concepts. Starting from an early age, building a strong background, can very likely prevent such situation.However, financial education necessarily involves quantifying and setting prices and value for services and goods. It can easily turn young people into cynical human beings who lack emotion. Furthermore, a tendency to self-concentration and egoism might rise when onemeasuring everything from a profit-making perspective.In conclusion, financial education has both pros and cons. In my opinion, the advantages are more significant than the disadvantages, making financial education an advisable component of the school program. The disadvantages should be thought of as a certain price that young people have to pay due to the characteristics of the world that we live in.

    ""Financial education should be a mandatory component of the school program. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?""

    [Essay]
    ""It is an obvious fact that financial aspects are a major part of the daily life, as an adult and even as a young individual. Each and every one of us has to make financial decisions concerning recreation, health, education and more. The question is whether to start with financial education as part of school program or to postpone it for a later stage in life.

To begin with, being able to understand the value of money, the way the economic system works and to interpret financial news and its implications is a virtue. Without this virtue, an individual, even a young one, might suffer to some extent. For an example, a child who doesn’t understand the concept of money might find it more difficult to except choosing only one present out of more possible ones.In addition, many adults are lacking capability of financial analysis. Quite often, the reason can be the lack of sound foundations or insecurity when it comes to financial terms and concepts. Starting from an early age, building a strong background, can very likely prevent such situation.However, financial education necessarily involves quantifying and setting prices and value for services and goods. It can easily turn young people into cynical human beings who lack emotion. Furthermore, a tendency to self-concentration and egoism might rise when onemeasuring everything from a profit-making perspective.In conclusion, financial education has both pros and cons. In my opinion, the advantages are more significant than the disadvantages, making financial education an advisable component of the school program. The disadvantages should be thought of as a certain price that young people have to pay due to the characteristics of the world that we live in.

            [Task]
            You are an IELTS examiner, and you are required to evaluate an IELTS academic essay based on four specific criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. Each criterion should be rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 represents the highest level of proficiency and 1 the lowest.
            The detailed criteria is the text till the tag [Topic]. The essay topic is the text between [Topic] and the tag [Essay]. The essay that you need to evaluate is the text between the tag [Essay] and the tag [Task]. 
            
            ""Task Response"" evaluates how well the candidate fully answers the question and develops his or her ideas. Responses must be a minimum of 250 words. If the essay has 200-250 words, you should subtract 1 point from the Task Response score you would like to give to the student. If the essay has 20-200 words - subtract 2 points. If the essay has fewer than 20 words, you should assign a score of 1 for all criteria. If the essay is totally off-topic, you should assign a 2 to this criterion.
            ""Coherence and Cohesion"" evaluates the overall clarity and fluency of the message: how the response organizes and links information, ideas, and language. Coherence refers to the logical sequencing of ideas, while cohesion refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (for example, logical connectors, pronouns, and conjunctions) to clarify conceptual and referential relationships between and within sentences.
            ""Lexical Resource"" refers to the range of vocabulary the candidate has used, as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of that use in relation to the specific task. Academic style is welcomed, you should subtract 2 points if the essay is not academic. 
            ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy refers to the variety and accuracy of the candidate's grammar, including the use of punctuation.
            
            You will provide detailed feedback and scores for each criterion, scores are a must have. The feedback must include evidence from the original essay and reference the grading criteria to support your ideas.
            
            The output format should include:
            • ""Task Response feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes word count, overall correspondence between topic and essay, and unity of ideas in each paragraph. If the essay is off-topic, you should point this out with evidence.  
            • ""Coherence and Cohesion feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes use of linking words and number of paragraphs. Appropriate use of linking words and substitutions should be rewarded. The desired number of paragraphs is between 3 and 10. Essays that do not follow this structure should be penalized. 
            • ""Lexical Resource feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes number and example of B2, C1, C2 words based on CEFR complexity, noticeable word repetition, spelling mistakes. Appropriate and more complicated words will be rewarded; inappropriate word choice, oral style, and noticeable word repetition will be penalized. Spelling errors should be corrected. 
            • ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes grammar concepts used, grammar errors, use of complex sentences, including B2, C1, C2 sentences based on CEFR complexity, clauses, sentence length, punctuation errors. Complex sentences and the variety of grammatical resources used should be rewarded. Grammar and punctuation errors should be penalized and corrected.
            
            Based on the [Fixed Criteria] provided earlier and the feedback for each criterion, you are required to assign scores in the following format:
            • ""Task Response score"": An integer score from 1 to 9.      
            • ""Coherence and Cohesion score"": An integer score from 1 to 9.
            • ""Lexical Resource score"": An integer score from 1 to 9.
            • ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy score"": An integer score from 1 to 9.
            Remember, your feedback should be supported with quotes from the original essay. 
            
            The output should look like this and each key should strictly have the name demonstrated bellow: 
            ""Task Response feedback"": 2-5 sentences with all evidence, ""Coherence and Cohesion feedback"":  2-5 sentences with all evidence, ""Lexical Resource feedback"":  2-5 sentences with all evidence, ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy feedback"":  2-5 sentences with all evidence, ""Task Response score"": an integer, ""Coherence and Cohesion score"": an integer, ""Lexical Resource score"": an integer, ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy score"": an integer.
            
            Please ensure that your output is formatted strictly in JSON, and it has 6 elements as shown above."
"Some people think that schools should select students according to their academic abilities, while others believe that it is better to have students with different abilities studying together. Discuss both views and state your own opinion.","Some people contend that mixed ability classes are more beneficial for children’s development than streaming them on the basis of judgement about their academic abilities. However, from my perspective, I disagree with this contention.

Admittedly, mixed ability classes provide a better environment for children’s all-round development. In such classes, children with different abilities study together and in turn they can learn from one another. From example, a student, who is good at academic study but weak in dancing or painting, can learn how to dance or paint form his peers. In this sense, mixed ability classes allow students to develop their abilities in different subjects instead of only academic abilities.

Despite the argument above, I believe streaming students brings more benefits to teachers and students. As for teachers, separating children with better academic abilities from others facilitates effective teaching. This practice helps teachers to control their students more conveniently and easily. Compared with mixed ability in which teacher should consider students’ differences when they are using teaching methodologies, streaming makes this situation simpler. To be more specific, students are at the same level of academic ability in a class, and in turn teachers can use the same methodologies for them all. In this way, the narrower the spread of ability in the class, the more convenient the teaching can be.

On top of this, steaming enables students to learn in an effective way.  According to students’ different abilities, they are taught in different ways that are more suitable for them. In the top streams, students use more difficult materials, therefore, they can learn more. In sharp contrast, teachers can explain the material more slowly to those in bottom streams. Under this circumstance, students with different academic abilities can study effectively and efficiently.

In the final analysis, mixed ability classes are beneficial for students’ versatile development, but in my opinion, segregating students based on different academic ability is better for both teachers and students.","[Fixed Criteria]

"Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programs (for example working for a charity, improving the neighborhood or teaching sports to younger children). To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is argued that voluntary services like charity, cleaning the neighborhood, imparting knowledge to the underprivileged, etc. should be made mandatory in the high school curriculum. I strongly agree to this as it not only helps in students becoming socially responsible adults but also in shaping their character.

Firstly, community service inculcates a sense of responsibility towards the society, something that is needed to shape a good society. For instance, the introduction of Swatch Bharath scheme in my school, The Hyderabad Public School, ten years ago taught me not only to keep the surroundings of the school clean but also to never litter wherever I go. Hence, now I feel responsible to maintain cleanliness everywhere. Such services are needed to develop a better society in the future.

Secondly, voluntary services cater to the overall character development of an individual. It inculcates a feeling of empathy in children which is needed to build a better character. For example, an alumnus of Montessori High School, who indulged in petty law-breaking activities during school confessed that it was the charity service that he did in high school; which engraved deep ideas and thoughts in his mind; helped him in becoming a better person for his family and refrained him from committing socially irresponsible acts. Thus, such voluntary activities teach us to value what we have and in turn contributes to our personality development.

That being said, we cannot deny the fact that many students misuse the time allocated for these services by considering it as an excursion to enjoy with friends rather than a learning experience.

In conclusion, although compulsory voluntary community service has its drawbacks, it is still useful in shaping a child as a socially responsible citizen and also in their overall personality development. Therefore, pupils should be encouraged to involve themselves in such activities.","[Fixed Criteria]

    ""Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programs (for example working for a charity, improving the neighborhood or teaching sports to younger children). To what extent do you agree or disagree?""

    [Essay]
    ""It is argued that voluntary services like charity, cleaning the neighborhood, imparting knowledge to the underprivileged, etc. should be made mandatory in the high school curriculum. I strongly agree to this as it not only helps in students becoming socially responsible adults but also in shaping their character.

Firstly, community service inculcates a sense of responsibility towards the society, something that is needed to shape a good society. For instance, the introduction of Swatch Bharath scheme in my school, The Hyderabad Public School, ten years ago taught me not only to keep the surroundings of the school clean but also to never litter wherever I go. Hence, now I feel responsible to maintain cleanliness everywhere. Such services are needed to develop a better society in the future.

Secondly, voluntary services cater to the overall character development of an individual. It inculcates a feeling of empathy in children which is needed to build a better character. For example, an alumnus of Montessori High School, who indulged in petty law-breaking activities during school confessed that it was the charity service that he did in high school; which engraved deep ideas and thoughts in his mind; helped him in becoming a better person for his family and refrained him from committing socially irresponsible acts. Thus, such voluntary activities teach us to value what we have and in turn contributes to our personality development.

That being said, we cannot deny the fact that many students misuse the time allocated for these services by considering it as an excursion to enjoy with friends rather than a learning experience.

In conclusion, although compulsory voluntary community service has its drawbacks, it is still useful in shaping a child as a socially responsible citizen and also in their overall personality development. Therefore, pupils should be encouraged to involve themselves in such activities.""
    
            [Task]
            You are an IELTS examiner, and you are required to evaluate an IELTS academic essay based on four specific criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. Each criterion should be rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 represents the highest level of proficiency and 1 the lowest.
            The detailed criteria is the text till the tag [Topic]. The essay topic is the text between [Topic] and the tag [Essay]. The essay that you need to evaluate is the text between the tag [Essay] and the tag [Task]. 
            
            ""Task Response"" evaluates how well the candidate fully answers the question and develops his or her ideas. Responses must be a minimum of 250 words. If the essay has 200-250 words, you should subtract 1 point from the Task Response score you would like to give to the student. If the essay has 20-200 words - subtract 2 points.

School teachers are more responsible for social and intellectual development of students than parents. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is often argued that educators have greater responsibility in developing students’ cognitive and social aspects compared to parents. I absolutely agree with this notion, as teachers are well-trained to teach formal lessons. Aside from that, school is the best place for children to socialize and make more friends.

It is known for a fact that parents play a vital role in the upbringing of their offsprings. Nevertheless, educating them at home alone does not always mean leading them to a bright future. For this reason, it is extremely important that children be given a formal education. This is when school teachers come into play. Apart from providing a conducive learning environment, most schools constantly update their faculty with various contemporary methods of teaching through seminars and trainings. This approach has long been practiced in order to ensure that students can cope with technological advancements. Furthermore, practical exercises and laboratory experiments significantly help increase their problem-solving, logical thinking, and reasoning abilities.

With regard to social aspect, it is also at school where youngsters learn to interact with peers. Apart from their daily classroom interactions, varied extracurricular activities are likewise offered to them, depending on their interests. These can be scouting, sporting events, and other organizations, just to name a few. These opportunities basically enhance leadership skills, camaraderie, and teamwork,  that may not be acquired at home alone. It is, therefore, not surprising that majority of friendships emanate from schools.

By and large, I strongly believe that when it comes to honing the overall academic and social skills of the youth, mentors have a more crucial role than parents. It is because they are professionally trained in performing so.","[Fixed Criteria]

Many people believe that learning a foreign language is a very difficult task. What are the most difficult things about learning a foreign language? What is the best way to overcome them? Explain and include your personal experience or knowledge of these problems.,"It is true that acquiring new language skills is by no means an easy task. Language learners might encounter several challenges such as unfamiliar accents or grammar structures in the learning process of a foreign language. However, in my opinion, such difficulties can be tackled by a well-rounded education system.

When it comes to languages, it is undeniably crucial to get used to a native accent and intonation for effective communication. However, picking up an accurate accent can be enormously difficult, especially for adult learners because of their lack of language learning ability. If a language learner has an unrecognisable accent and intonation, they would not be understood by native speakers. On top of that, each language has different grammar and typical grammatical sequencing of words. For example, Korean sentences always end with verbs whilst English does not, which means that a Korean English-learner should consider about the correct order of words.

Despite the aforementioned difficulties, I strongly believe that everyone can master a foreign language when a couple of feasible steps are taken. Firstly, it is more important than anything to start learning a new language at a young age. By incorporating foreign language programmes in the primary school curriculum, children can easily be exposed to languages of the world and eventually acquire language skills without difficulties. Secondly, the government can financially subsidise schools to run student exchange programmes that help adolescents to get experiences abroad and make friends overseas while improving their foreign language in a delight way.

In conclusion, I believe that individuals can have difficulties in learning a new language because of different accents and unfamiliar grammar,  however, these problems can be overcome by a good quality of education system subsidised by governments.","[Fixed Criteria]

    ""Many people believe that learning a foreign language is a very difficult task. What are the most difficult things about learning a foreign language? What is the best way to overcome them? Explain and include your personal experience or knowledge of these problems.""

    [Essay]
    ""It is true that acquiring new language skills is by no means an easy task. Language learners might encounter several challenges such as unfamiliar accents or grammar structures in the learning process of a foreign language. However, in my opinion, such difficulties can be tackled by a well-rounded education system.

When it comes to languages, it is undeniably crucial to get used to a native accent and intonation for effective communication. However, picking up an accurate accent can be enormously difficult, especially for adult learners because of their lack of language learning ability. If a language learner has an unrecognisable accent and intonation, they would not be understood by native speakers. On top of that, each language has different grammar and typical grammatical sequencing of words. For example, Korean sentences always end with verbs whilst English does not, which means that a Korean English-learner should consider about the correct order of words.

Despite the aforementioned difficulties, I strongly believe that everyone can master a foreign language when a couple of feasible steps are taken. Firstly, it is more important than anything to start learning a new language at a young age. By incorporating foreign language programmes in the primary school curriculum, children can easily be exposed to languages of the world and eventually acquire language skills without difficulties. Secondly, the government can financially subsidise schools to run student exchange programmes that help adolescents to get experiences abroad and make friends overseas while improving their foreign language in a delight way.

In conclusion, I believe that individuals can have difficulties in learning a new language because of different accents and unfamiliar grammar,  however, these problems can be overcome by a good quality of education system subsidised by governments.""
    
            [Task]
            You are an IELTS examiner, and you are required to evaluate an IELTS academic essay based on four specific criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. Each criterion should be rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 represents the highest level of proficiency and 1 the lowest.
            The detailed criteria is the text till the tag [Topic]. The essay topic is the text between [Topic] and the tag [Essay]. The essay that you need to evaluate is the text between the tag [Essay] and the tag [Task]. 
            
            ""Task Response"" evaluates how well the candidate fully answers the question and develops his or her ideas. Responses must be a minimum of 250 words. If the essay has 200-250 words, you should subtract 1 point from the Task Response score you would like to give to the student. If the essay has 20-200 words - subtract 2 points. If the essay has fewer than 20 words, you should assign a score of 1 for all criteria. If the essay is totally off-topic, you should assign a 2 to this criterion.
            ""Coherence and Cohesion"" evaluates the overall clarity and fluency of the message: how the response organizes and links information, ideas, and language. Coherence refers to the logical sequencing of ideas, while cohesion refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (for example, logical connectors, pronouns, and conjunctions) to clarify conceptual and referential relationships between and within sentences.
            ""Lexical Resource"" refers to the range of vocabulary the candidate has used, as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of that use in relation to the specific task. Academic style is welcomed, you should subtract 2 points if the essay is not academic. 
            ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy refers to the variety and accuracy of the candidate's grammar, including the use of punctuation.
            
            You will provide detailed feedback and scores for each criterion, scores are a must have. The feedback must include evidence from the original essay and reference the grading criteria to support your ideas.

Evidence includes use of linking words and number of paragraphs. Appropriate use of linking words and substitutions should be rewarded. The desired number of paragraphs is between 3 and 10. Essays that do not follow this structure should be penalized. 
            • ""Lexical Resource feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes number and example of B2, C1, C2 words based on CEFR complexity, noticeable word repetition, spelling mistakes. Appropriate and more complicated words will be rewarded; inappropriate word choice, oral style, and noticeable word repetition will be penalized. Spelling errors should be corrected. 
            • ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes grammar concepts used, grammar errors, use of complex sentences, including B2, C1, C2 sentences based on CEFR complexity, clauses, sentence length, punctuation errors. Complex sentences and the variety of grammatical resources used should be rewarded. Grammar and punctuation errors should be penalized and corrected.
            
            Based on the [Fixed Criteria] provided earlier and the feedback for each criterion, you are required to assign scores in the following format:

"Some people believe that preserving natural environment is crucial, however, most make no effort to do so. Why do you think this is happening? What are some simple actions that could help the environment?","It is commonly believed that preservation of natural resources is imperative, yet most people seem to exert no effort in doing so. Understanding the causes of this negligent attitude may help with devising some simple measures to safeguard the deteriorating environment.

Lack of awareness is probably the foremost reason why the vast majority of individuals appears to be unmindful of the current environmental issues. Normally, people have tendency to downplay abstract problems, or those that likely to happen in the distant future. This is because they are not properly informed of the possible detrimental effects of taking the environment for granted. To illustrate, residents in urban areas often deliberately dump their wastes into the nearby creeks and drainage canals causing them to become clogged. It is only when devastating floods strike, that they come to realize the consequences of their actions.

Some basic solutions that could be carried out are extensive awareness campaign through all forms of communication and strict implementation of waste management. In addition to the traditional press, social media is a powerful means of disseminating information regarding the impending disasters and their potential hazards. This is a good way of persuading the public to actively take part in the campaign. Another straightforward solution, and by far the least anyone can do to help save the nature is disposing of garbage thoughtfully. Apart from avoiding throwing trash anywhere, everyone should practice proper segregation of biodegradable, non-biodegradable, and recyclable wastes at all times. These actions, when coordinated by the local governments, can be tremendously successful.

In conclusion, while individual awareness is key to maintaining a healthy ecosystem, concerted efforts of governments and their citizens are much more effective in achieving such goal.","[Fixed Criteria]

"In many countries children are engaged in different kinds of paid work. Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it a valuable work experience, important for learning and taking responsibility. What is your opinion?","The issue of whether or not children should be engaged in some paid work has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that having some employment experience is conducive to a child’s learning and development, I contend that it would bring harm to the child’s heath and learning.

First of all, a workplace designed for adults is normally shortage of child-friendly facilities. Desks and chairs are too high for a child; the light switches are installed on the walls unreachable by children; also emergency training and facilities such as phones are only provided to adults. Furthermore, various hazards such as polluted air and chemical fumes are still produced in factories and farms. Undoubtedly young people would suffer in such workplaces.

Also, children would find it frustrating when they are not properly inducted before starting a job. A child working in a cement factory would feel a setback when he could not get immediate support while struggling with the procedures of recording different raw materials that is required by the job. Further, without sufficient support, a child’s misunderstanding or inappropriately communicating with adults would only disappoint him and prevents him from active learning and interacting with other people.

To conclude, a child’s paid employment experience would lead to a negative impact on their health and active learning. However, recognizing the importance of children’s learning and their awareness of responsibility, it is advisable to encourage them to be involved in some volunteering opportunities where they can meaningfully learn and interact with other people with sufficient care and support in place for such jobs.","[Fixed Criteria]

    ""In many countries children are engaged in different kinds of paid work. Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it a valuable work experience, important for learning and taking responsibility. What is your opinion?""

    [Essay]
    ""The issue of whether or not children should be engaged in some paid work has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that having some employment experience is conducive to a child’s learning and development, I contend that it would bring harm to the child’s heath and learning.

First of all, a workplace designed for adults is normally shortage of child-friendly facilities. Desks and chairs are too high for a child; the light switches are installed on the walls unreachable by children; also emergency training and facilities such as phones are only provided to adults. Furthermore, various hazards such as polluted air and chemical fumes are still produced in factories and farms. Undoubtedly young people would suffer in such workplaces.

Also, children would find it frustrating when they are not properly inducted before starting a job. A child working in a cement factory would feel a setback when he could not get immediate support while struggling with the procedures of recording different raw materials that is required by the job. Further, without sufficient support, a child’s misunderstanding or inappropriately communicating with adults would only disappoint him and prevents him from active learning and interacting with other people.

Modern children are suffering from the diseases that were once considered to be meant for adults only. Obesity is a major disease prevalent among children. What are its causes and what solutions can be offered?,"Nowadays, the increasing rate of overweight children and adults is a worldwide health issue. Obesity is a major problem which is increasing day by day in school going children. There are various reasons behind it. This essay will discuss the causes of obesity and offer some solutions.

The first cause of obesity is junk food. It is often seen that mostly children are fond of burgers, pizzas, noodles and coke. These types of foods are easily available to them in school canteens. Children love to purchase chips, chocholates, - ice-cream for lunch. Moreover, in this modern era, parents are working and they do not have time to cook at home. Parents often buy dinner for their children instead of preparing food at home. This calorie-rich diet is making children obese. This problem can be solved by teaching children to cook healthy foods for themselves and banning junk foods and fizzy drinks in schools. This diet can be replaced by milk, juice and fruits for lunch.

The second cause of obesity is sedentry life style. It is true that the use of computers and television is increasing in children. They spend most of their time watching television or playing video games on a computer. This technological advancement has reduced the level of physical activity in this specific age group. This issue can be resolved by encouraging children to do physical exercises. Parents can take their children to park to encourage playing with friends. Furthermore, schools can add sports in their curriculum to maintain physical fitness in their students.

To sum up, it is clear that main causes of obesity are unhealthy eating and not enough physical activities. This ailment can be prevented and treated by healthy eating habbits and physical exercises.","[Fixed Criteria]

"Some people think it is better for children to grown up in the city, while others think that life in the countryside is more suitable for them. What are the advantages and disadvantages of both places?","Living in the rural area is thought as the best option for children by a group of people, while others believe that cities offer more opportunities. In my opinion, if the city offers security and green areas, I agree it is a better place to raise the next generation enjoying some advantages from both sides.

Firstly, the countryside let children be in touch with nature, taking care of animals and helping with the gardening. Because of that, they learn how to protect the environment and to live without any technological equipment. Besides that, they have more freedom to play outside the house without any security worries, whereas in the city they are kept at home using smartphones and computers for this reason. On the other hand, schools usually have lower quality and it is hard to find extracurricular classes. Therefore, children have difficulties trying to develop their abilities besides the school curriculum.

However, schools at metropolitan areas tend to have better quality and offer all kinds of activities. Even if there is a sport or an art course that the institution does not offer, it is possible to look for it in another place around the city. As a result, all children’s talents and passions can be easier to develop. On the other hand, security, pollution and low contact with nature are issues that we have to worry about. The better option would be a city with an excellent quality of life where children could play in parks and gardens.

To sum up, growing up in the countryside can be very positive for someone’s childhood, but the city will usually offer better opportunities for their talents’ development.","[Fixed Criteria]

            [Task]
            You are an IELTS examiner, and you are required to evaluate an IELTS academic essay based on four specific criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. Each criterion should be rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 represents the highest level of proficiency and 1 the lowest.
            The detailed criteria is the text till the tag [Topic]. The essay topic is the text between [Topic] and the tag [Essay]. The essay that you need to evaluate is the text between the tag [Essay] and the tag [Task]. 
            
            ""Task Response"" evaluates how well the candidate fully answers the question and develops his or her ideas. Responses must be a minimum of 250 words. If the essay has 200-250 words, you should subtract 1 point from the Task Response score you would like to give to the student. If the essay has 20-200 words - subtract 2 points. If the essay has fewer than 20 words, you should assign a score of 1 for all criteria. If the essay is totally off-topic, you should assign a 2 to this criterion.
            ""Coherence and Cohesion"" evaluates the overall clarity and fluency of the message: how the response organizes and links information, ideas, and language. Coherence refers to the logical sequencing of ideas, while cohesion refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (for example, logical connectors, pronouns, and conjunctions) to clarify conceptual and referential relationships between and within sentences.
            ""Lexical Resource"" refers to the range of vocabulary the candidate has used, as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of that use in relation to the specific task. Academic style is welcomed, you should subtract 2 points if the essay is not academic. 
            ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy refers to the variety and accuracy of the candidate's grammar, including the use of punctuation.
            
            You will provide detailed feedback and scores for each criterion, scores are a must have. The feedback must include evidence from the original essay and reference the grading criteria to support your ideas.
            
            The output format should include:

Evidence includes word count, overall correspondence between topic and essay, and unity of ideas in each paragraph. If the essay is off-topic, you should point this out with evidence.  
            • ""Coherence and Cohesion feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes use of linking words and number of paragraphs. Appropriate use of linking words and substitutions should be rewarded. The desired number of paragraphs is between 3 and 10. Essays that do not follow this structure should be penalized. 
            • ""Lexical Resource feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes number and example of B2, C1, C2 words based on CEFR complexity, noticeable word repetition, spelling mistakes. Appropriate and more complicated words will be rewarded; inappropriate word choice, oral style, and noticeable word repetition will be penalized. Spelling errors should be corrected. 
            • ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes grammar concepts used, grammar errors, use of complex sentences, including B2, C1, C2 sentences based on CEFR complexity, clauses, sentence length, punctuation errors.

"Nowadays families move to different countries for work. Some people think it has a negative effect on children, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Recent advancements, in technology and transportation in particular, are reshaping our world in an unprecedented manner. Nowadays, it is not unusual for people to work abroad. Most expatriates relocate their families to the countries they work at. Some people argue that this phenomenon negatively affects children, however, I agree with those who believe the opposite is true.

Those who think that relocating children to a new place is undesirable do so for many reasons. Their most common argument is the negative impact of moving on a child’s personality. There is no doubt that living in a different community comes with its challenges, especially to young people, as they get exposed to behaviours, actions and customs they might not be familiar with. As a result, children could possibly feel a lack of stability and some confusion. It is also likely that their patriotic feelings and sense of belonging to their home country could weaken as they would miss many opportunities to celebrate their national events.

Nevertheless, I firmly believe that opinion to be ludicrous, as it seems that getting exposed to a new culture is beneficial in many ways. It fosters young people social and emotional capabilities. Moreover, children living abroad have better opportunities to lean and practice new languages. Mastering more than one language improves not only their intellectual development, but also their opportunities in acquiring better jobs in the future. According to a recent study published by the University of Chicago, competency in more than one language increases employment chances on average by 200%.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that living in a different country positively affects children in all aspects. Acquiring new languages, and an open minded and tolerant personality are just few examples of the many possible benefits.","[Fixed Criteria]

            ""Coherence and Cohesion"" evaluates the overall clarity and fluency of the message: how the response organizes and links information, ideas, and language. Coherence refers to the logical sequencing of ideas, while cohesion refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (for example, logical connectors, pronouns, and conjunctions) to clarify conceptual and referential relationships between and within sentences.
            ""Lexical Resource"" refers to the range of vocabulary the candidate has used, as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of that use in relation to the specific task. Academic style is welcomed, you should subtract 2 points if the essay is not academic. 
            ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy refers to the variety and accuracy of the candidate's grammar, including the use of punctuation.

Childcare training courses should be mandatory for all parents. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your own opinion and include relevant examples.,"It is true that parents need some knowledge and experience in order to raise their kids in an appropriate way. In this regard, many families attend different training courses. While I agree that these courses might be useful for some of them, I totally disagree with the recommended obligatory pattern of such training.

On the one hand, training courses usually offered by governments could be very useful for those guardians who have a kid with special needs. For example, if a child has a birth defect or has been diagnosed with any mental or musculoskeletal disorders, these kinds of training could be lifesaving. Additionally, as we know, the first few months after birth are really a crucial period of a child’s life; parents should obtain different information related to their child’s vaccinations, common health problems, different developmental issues and so on, which can be delivered through such training courses.

On the other hand, I believe that making these programs as a mandatory option would cause several problems for societies and individuals as well. To begin with, in order to achieve this goal, many professionals should be trained which may not be affordable for some governments. From an individual’s point of view, this kind of mandatory programs could be very time-consuming for some families who have other kids at home or who work long hours. The other important consideration is that parent training courses may not provide all the necessary information for each and every family. To be more specific, parents could get more beneficial information through different websites such as YouTube according to their own preferences.

In conclusion, although I believe that many families can take advantage from training courses, I do believe that making them as a compulsory option for everyone is too time and money-consuming for individuals and governments.","[Fixed Criteria]

            You are an IELTS examiner, and you are required to evaluate an IELTS academic essay based on four specific criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. Each criterion should be rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 represents the highest level of proficiency and 1 the lowest.
            The detailed criteria is the text till the tag [Topic]. The essay topic is the text between [Topic] and the tag [Essay]. The essay that you need to evaluate is the text between the tag [Essay] and the tag [Task]. 
            
            ""Task Response"" evaluates how well the candidate fully answers the question and develops his or her ideas. Responses must be a minimum of 250 words. If the essay has 200-250 words, you should subtract 1 point from the Task Response score you would like to give to the student. If the essay has 20-200 words - subtract 2 points. If the essay has fewer than 20 words, you should assign a score of 1 for all criteria. If the essay is totally off-topic, you should assign a 2 to this criterion.
            ""Coherence and Cohesion"" evaluates the overall clarity and fluency of the message: how the response organizes and links information, ideas, and language. Coherence refers to the logical sequencing of ideas, while cohesion refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (for example, logical connectors, pronouns, and conjunctions) to clarify conceptual and referential relationships between and within sentences.
            ""Lexical Resource"" refers to the range of vocabulary the candidate has used, as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of that use in relation to the specific task. Academic style is welcomed, you should subtract 2 points if the essay is not academic.

Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. Why do you think people waste food? What can be done to reduce the amount of food they throw away?,"At the time when famines heavily strike impoverished third world countries, many people living in wealthy countries waste tremendous amounts of food daily. In my opinion, understanding the probable reasons of this phenomenon is important and may lead us to some applicable solutions that will result in reducing food waste.

The low cost of food seems to be one of the obvious reasons, exacerbating the problem. Due to the revolutionary technological achievements, people have increased both the quality and the quantity of their crops. In turn, according to the laws of supply and demand, the prices of the crops have immensely dropped. A recent study of the FAO stated that the global crops prices have dropped 50 per cent over the last decade. This enabled people to buy excessive amounts of food without a real need.

Furthermore, the absence of strict regulations to discourage or punish this attitude can also be considered a major cause. Not everyone is aware that wasting food may create problems. Consequently, they are likely to resist any calls for controlling the consumption of dietary supplies unless they are forced by the power of law. Several countries in the world saw a drop in their national food waste after implementing a ban on the excessive purchasing of food.

Fortunately, there are some possible approaches that can be adopted by both people and governments. Firstly, raising the awareness of this issue is immensely important. Using social media platforms can draw public attention to the potential dangers of food waste and how communities can confront it. Secondly, enforcing laws that prohibit the wasting of food by people and companies will deter such harmful practice.

In conclusion, the decreased price of food as well as lack of regulations allowed the unfortunate trend of throwing away food to continue. I believe that creating awareness and legislation are parts of a straightforward solution to this issue.","[Fixed Criteria]

    ""Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. Why do you think people waste food? What can be done to reduce the amount of food they throw away?""

    [Essay]
    ""At the time when famines heavily strike impoverished third world countries, many people living in wealthy countries waste tremendous amounts of food daily. In my opinion, understanding the probable reasons of this phenomenon is important and may lead us to some applicable solutions that will result in reducing food waste.

The low cost of food seems to be one of the obvious reasons, exacerbating the problem. Due to the revolutionary technological achievements, people have increased both the quality and the quantity of their crops. In turn, according to the laws of supply and demand, the prices of the crops have immensely dropped. A recent study of the FAO stated that the global crops prices have dropped 50 per cent over the last decade. This enabled people to buy excessive amounts of food without a real need.

Furthermore, the absence of strict regulations to discourage or punish this attitude can also be considered a major cause. Not everyone is aware that wasting food may create problems. Consequently, they are likely to resist any calls for controlling the consumption of dietary supplies unless they are forced by the power of law. Several countries in the world saw a drop in their national food waste after implementing a ban on the excessive purchasing of food.

Fortunately, there are some possible approaches that can be adopted by both people and governments. Firstly, raising the awareness of this issue is immensely important. Using social media platforms can draw public attention to the potential dangers of food waste and how communities can confront it. Secondly, enforcing laws that prohibit the wasting of food by people and companies will deter such harmful practice.

In conclusion, the decreased price of food as well as lack of regulations allowed the unfortunate trend of throwing away food to continue. I believe that creating awareness and legislation are parts of a straightforward solution to this issue.""
    
            [Task]
            You are an IELTS examiner, and you are required to evaluate an IELTS academic essay based on four specific criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. Each criterion should be rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 represents the highest level of proficiency and 1 the lowest.
            The detailed criteria is the text till the tag [Topic]. The essay topic is the text between [Topic] and the tag [Essay]. The essay that you need to evaluate is the text between the tag [Essay] and the tag [Task]. 
            
            ""Task Response"" evaluates how well the candidate fully answers the question and develops his or her ideas. Responses must be a minimum of 250 words. If the essay has 200-250 words, you should subtract 1 point from the Task Response score you would like to give to the student. If the essay has 20-200 words - subtract 2 points. If the essay has fewer than 20 words, you should assign a score of 1 for all criteria. If the essay is totally off-topic, you should assign a 2 to this criterion.
            ""Coherence and Cohesion"" evaluates the overall clarity and fluency of the message: how the response organizes and links information, ideas, and language. Coherence refers to the logical sequencing of ideas, while cohesion refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (for example, logical connectors, pronouns, and conjunctions) to clarify conceptual and referential relationships between and within sentences.
            ""Lexical Resource"" refers to the range of vocabulary the candidate has used, as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of that use in relation to the specific task. Academic style is welcomed, you should subtract 2 points if the essay is not academic. 
            ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy refers to the variety and accuracy of the candidate's grammar, including the use of punctuation.
            
            You will provide detailed feedback and scores for each criterion, scores are a must have. The feedback must include evidence from the original essay and reference the grading criteria to support your ideas.
            
            The output format should include:
            • ""Task Response feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay.

Evidence includes use of linking words and number of paragraphs. Appropriate use of linking words and substitutions should be rewarded. The desired number of paragraphs is between 3 and 10. Essays that do not follow this structure should be penalized. 
            • ""Lexical Resource feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes number and example of B2, C1, C2 words based on CEFR complexity, noticeable word repetition, spelling mistakes. Appropriate and more complicated words will be rewarded; inappropriate word choice, oral style, and noticeable word repetition will be penalized. Spelling errors should be corrected. 
            • ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes grammar concepts used, grammar errors, use of complex sentences, including B2, C1, C2 sentences based on CEFR complexity, clauses, sentence length, punctuation errors. Complex sentences and the variety of grammatical resources used should be rewarded. Grammar and punctuation errors should be penalized and corrected.
            
            Based on the [Fixed Criteria] provided earlier and the feedback for each criterion, you are required to assign scores in the following format:

Nowadays many people choose ready-made food and refuse to cook at home. Why do you think it happens? What are the advantages and disadvantages of such a choice?,"It is a very popular practice in the modern society to order ready-made food from restaurants, rather than cooking at home. The main reasons for such a tendency may be cheap prices in some restaurants and people’s desire to save some time from cooking. Even though ordering food have some obvious advantages, its disadvantages should not be underestimated.

On the one hand, ordering prepared food may be the best choice for a busy person, who does not have time for cooking and cleaning. Cooking food at home requires a considerable amount of time, moreover the cleaning process may take even more time and resources than cooking itself. For example, cooking a simple dish such as chicken with rice and home requires significant amounts of water and electricity for electrical appliances such as the oven and dishwasher. Hence, having an opportunity to order food from a restaurant will save a lot of time, electricity and water.

On the other hand, delegating the process of cooking to some restaurant have a dramatic disadvantage of not having the information about the ingredients used in the meals. With high demand, grow the volumes of required products, which sometimes can affect the quality of purchased produce. For example, it is a very common practice in some restaurants to make salads from products that are about to go bad and mask the rotten scent by adding some chemicals and spices. Hence, some restaurants may use poor quality products or chemicals for boosting taste and preservatives, which may have a negative effect on the customer’s health in the long run.

In conclusion, ordering food from restaurants may be a tempting choice for people who have no time for cooking at home, but this approach has a critical disadvantage of being not informed about the ingredients used in the meal, which can have destructive consequences.","[Fixed Criteria]

Many people believe that reducing speed limits is the best option for road safety improvement. Do you think there are other measures that could be put in place? What are the advantages and disadvantages of this?,"One of the most conspicuous trends of today’s world is a colossal surge in the number of such vehicle accidents as cars, trucks and buses, all over the world, be it in impoverished or developed nations. There is a wide range of factors that account for why this is happening. In my opinion, this situation could be remedied, provided some effective measures are taken.

Measures to deal with this soaring concern are many; the most significant ones are not remote or complicated but accessible and practicable. The primary one lies in the fact that governments should take a firm stance and apply stringent rules and regulations to lower the speed limit. Secondly, using the electronic devices while driving should be forbidden by law. Finally, an awareness program could be initiated by individuals to educate the public about the catastrophic effects of unsafe roads and the projected enhancements for road safety. Only when convergent efforts from all sectors are ensured, can we expect to see considerable progress in tackling this problem.

There is a deluge of merits for implementation of reduced speed limits. High speed is likely to impose life threatening danger on people crossing the roads, due to the perilous nature of this hazardous speed with danger being an integral part of it. Not only does reducing the speed limits contribute to decreasing daily accidents, but it also raises the standard of driving. Needless to say, all these advantages have a far-reaching impact on pedestrian safety.

There are, however, some pitfalls that can easily overpower the potential benefits of limiting speed. The primary one stems from the fact that slowing the speed could lead to augmenting the daily traffic hours. Besides, it could also delay delivering sick and severe patients to hospitals. Hence, it is apparent why some individuals are against changing the standardized level of speed.

From what has been discussed, one can conclude that despite the drawbacks of reducing speed limits, the expected benefits of this measure are indeed far greater.","[Fixed Criteria]

    ""Many people believe that reducing speed limits is the best option for road safety improvement. Do you think there are other measures that could be put in place? What are the advantages and disadvantages of this?""

    [Essay]
    ""One of the most conspicuous trends of today’s world is a colossal surge in the number of such vehicle accidents as cars, trucks and buses, all over the world, be it in impoverished or developed nations. There is a wide range of factors that account for why this is happening. In my opinion, this situation could be remedied, provided some effective measures are taken.

Measures to deal with this soaring concern are many; the most significant ones are not remote or complicated but accessible and practicable. The primary one lies in the fact that governments should take a firm stance and apply stringent rules and regulations to lower the speed limit. Secondly, using the electronic devices while driving should be forbidden by law. Finally, an awareness program could be initiated by individuals to educate the public about the catastrophic effects of unsafe roads and the projected enhancements for road safety. Only when convergent efforts from all sectors are ensured, can we expect to see considerable progress in tackling this problem.

There is a deluge of merits for implementation of reduced speed limits. High speed is likely to impose life threatening danger on people crossing the roads, due to the perilous nature of this hazardous speed with danger being an integral part of it. Not only does reducing the speed limits contribute to decreasing daily accidents, but it also raises the standard of driving. Needless to say, all these advantages have a far-reaching impact on pedestrian safety.

There are, however, some pitfalls that can easily overpower the potential benefits of limiting speed. The primary one stems from the fact that slowing the speed could lead to augmenting the daily traffic hours. Besides, it could also delay delivering sick and severe patients to hospitals. Hence, it is apparent why some individuals are against changing the standardized level of speed.

From what has been discussed, one can conclude that despite the drawbacks of reducing speed limits, the expected benefits of this measure are indeed far greater.""
    
            [Task]
            You are an IELTS examiner, and you are required to evaluate an IELTS academic essay based on four specific criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. Each criterion should be rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 represents the highest level of proficiency and 1 the lowest.
            The detailed criteria is the text till the tag [Topic]. The essay topic is the text between [Topic] and the tag [Essay]. The essay that you need to evaluate is the text between the tag [Essay] and the tag [Task]. 
            
            ""Task Response"" evaluates how well the candidate fully answers the question and develops his or her ideas. Responses must be a minimum of 250 words. If the essay has 200-250 words, you should subtract 1 point from the Task Response score you would like to give to the student. If the essay has 20-200 words - subtract 2 points. If the essay has fewer than 20 words, you should assign a score of 1 for all criteria. If the essay is totally off-topic, you should assign a 2 to this criterion.
            ""Coherence and Cohesion"" evaluates the overall clarity and fluency of the message: how the response organizes and links information, ideas, and language. Coherence refers to the logical sequencing of ideas, while cohesion refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (for example, logical connectors, pronouns, and conjunctions) to clarify conceptual and referential relationships between and within sentences.
            ""Lexical Resource"" refers to the range of vocabulary the candidate has used, as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of that use in relation to the specific task. Academic style is welcomed, you should subtract 2 points if the essay is not academic. 
            ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy refers to the variety and accuracy of the candidate's grammar, including the use of punctuation.
            
            You will provide detailed feedback and scores for each criterion, scores are a must have. The feedback must include evidence from the original essay and reference the grading criteria to support your ideas.

Evidence includes use of linking words and number of paragraphs. Appropriate use of linking words and substitutions should be rewarded. The desired number of paragraphs is between 3 and 10. Essays that do not follow this structure should be penalized. 
            • ""Lexical Resource feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes number and example of B2, C1, C2 words based on CEFR complexity, noticeable word repetition, spelling mistakes. Appropriate and more complicated words will be rewarded; inappropriate word choice, oral style, and noticeable word repetition will be penalized. Spelling errors should be corrected. 
            • ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes grammar concepts used, grammar errors, use of complex sentences, including B2, C1, C2 sentences based on CEFR complexity, clauses, sentence length, punctuation errors. Complex sentences and the variety of grammatical resources used should be rewarded. Grammar and punctuation errors should be penalized and corrected.
            
            Based on the [Fixed Criteria] provided earlier and the feedback for each criterion, you are required to assign scores in the following format:

Some people believe that the government should take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement. What is your opinion? Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your own experience.,"It is true that when people advance into their golden years, they require more help and attention. For that reason, a significant number of people hold the opinion that the government should provide financial assistance to the elderly. However, I tend to agree with those who argue that workers should be saving a portion of their income to have a nest egg in their retirement.

To begin with, a culture of saving rather than depending on the government may foster the overall economic development of a country. In other words, if people were to accumulate their own savings for their pension age, it would lessen the financial burden on the government. As a result, the government would be able to release more funds to more productive purposes, such as development of infrastructure, industries, hospitals, and so on, which may expedite the overall progression of a country.

In addition to economic factors, putting money aside has some personal benefits. Since savings-oriented people are not dependent on the state for their living expenses, this may instill a sense of self-respect and pride in them. On the other hand, those who are reliant on financial assistance very often face the negative societal stigma, as many people consider them to be inferior and unworthy members of society. Hence, to live a life with dignity and pride, taking responsibility for funding one’s own retirement is evidently a better option from individual perspective.

In contrast, the provision of monetary outlays for retirees has proven unfeasible in many countries. Since in many nations the number of senior citizens is on the rise, in the long run governments are likely to struggle to sustain the cost of providing for the elderly. The early signs of this have been seen in many countries that were forced to raise the retirement age, including my home country where men can now retire at the age of 67 instead of 65. Therefore, in the foreseeable future, these kinds of support may become completely unsustainable.

In conclusion, the provision of state monetary support may undoubtedly lessen the concern of retirees to some extent. However, considering the issue of sustainability of this provision, it is better to opt for individual savings from the very beginning of working life, for the benefit of both individual and national development.","[Fixed Criteria]

    [Topic]
    ""Some people believe that the government should take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement. What is your opinion? Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your own experience.""

    [Essay]
    ""It is true that when people advance into their golden years, they require more help and attention. For that reason, a significant number of people hold the opinion that the government should provide financial assistance to the elderly. However, I tend to agree with those who argue that workers should be saving a portion of their income to have a nest egg in their retirement.

To begin with, a culture of saving rather than depending on the government may foster the overall economic development of a country. In other words, if people were to accumulate their own savings for their pension age, it would lessen the financial burden on the government. As a result, the government would be able to release more funds to more productive purposes, such as development of infrastructure, industries, hospitals, and so on, which may expedite the overall progression of a country.

In addition to economic factors, putting money aside has some personal benefits. Since savings-oriented people are not dependent on the state for their living expenses, this may instill a sense of self-respect and pride in them. On the other hand, those who are reliant on financial assistance very often face the negative societal stigma, as many people consider them to be inferior and unworthy members of society. Hence, to live a life with dignity and pride, taking responsibility for funding one’s own retirement is evidently a better option from individual perspective.

In contrast, the provision of monetary outlays for retirees has proven unfeasible in many countries. Since in many nations the number of senior citizens is on the rise, in the long run governments are likely to struggle to sustain the cost of providing for the elderly. The early signs of this have been seen in many countries that were forced to raise the retirement age, including my home country where men can now retire at the age of 67 instead of 65. Therefore, in the foreseeable future, these kinds of support may become completely unsustainable.

In conclusion, the provision of state monetary support may undoubtedly lessen the concern of retirees to some extent. However, considering the issue of sustainability of this provision, it is better to opt for individual savings from the very beginning of working life, for the benefit of both individual and national development.""
    
            [Task]
            You are an IELTS examiner, and you are required to evaluate an IELTS academic essay based on four specific criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. Each criterion should be rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 represents the highest level of proficiency and 1 the lowest.
            The detailed criteria is the text till the tag [Topic]. The essay topic is the text between [Topic] and the tag [Essay]. The essay that you need to evaluate is the text between the tag [Essay] and the tag [Task]. 
            
            ""Task Response"" evaluates how well the candidate fully answers the question and develops his or her ideas. Responses must be a minimum of 250 words. If the essay has 200-250 words, you should subtract 1 point from the Task Response score you would like to give to the student. If the essay has 20-200 words - subtract 2 points.

"Some people think that public health within a country can be improved by government making laws regarding nutritious food. Others, however, think that health is a matter of personal choice and responsibility. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Personal and public health are tightly related to food choices. While some people believe that the government should regulate nutrition to improve public wellness, others argue that it should be people’s decision whether to pursue a healthy diet or not. This essay will discuss both points of view and explain why the authorities should not control the types of food people can buy.

Legislators could impose laws concerning nutritious food in an effort to have a healthier population, therefore, decreasing public health costs. Even if this could be considered a good idea, it would be very quite difficult to implement. To achieve this target, the rulers could impose a levy on unhealthy food options, or reduce their availability on the grocery stores shelves. In Italy, for example, products such as carbonated sugary drinks and chips are heavily taxed. As a result, the sales of these items have decreased. However, if the authorities start to take control of what their citizens can or cannot eat, it may be seen as limitation of freedom.

Since personal freedom is an extremely important human right, many people think that they should be responsible for their choices regarding the food and drinks they decide to consume. I agree with this opinion because limiting nutritional options, even if it is done with the best outcome in mind, could consequently create dissatisfaction among the population, which would possibly lead to other public issues such as protests and demonstrations. A better approach could be educating the public about a healthy diet, which would help people make better-informed decisions about the food they consume. Many developed countries around the world employed this strategy and saw public health gains.

In conclusion, even though the government is able to control the dietary habits of its population through taxation and restrictions, healthier citizens and reduced public health expenses isn’t the only possible outcome. Limiting personal freedom could result in social unrest and for that reason diet decisions are better to be left up to well-informed individuals.","[Fixed Criteria]

However, in my view, providing the general public with access to trustworthy information about medical disorders would invariably improve the quality of the medical care for the whole society.

Nowadays, even though there are plenty of online platforms have been developed for medical education, most of the sites have not been written by professional healthcare providers. Hence, there is a high possibility of spreading wrong medical information throughout the world, unless the site developers are held accountable for the content they provide. If patients receive incorrect information about a medical procedure and follow the wrong advice, for instance, to remove a wart at home, it might lead to a serious infection, excessive bleeding or another medical emergency. That would constitute a negative effect of using online knowledge for medical treatments at home rather than visiting a professional.

On the flip side, for the sake of the Internet, the society is well aware of  most common medical disorders and preventive measures. Consequently, a reasonable and prudent individual can decide whether to get professional opinion on one’s disease or to handle it at home, providing that they get reliable online medical information. Moreover, if patients can manage mild medical problems themselves, it would certainly reduce the workload at the local hospitals, freeing more doctors for patients in real need. Besides, if patients come with a certain extent of knowledge about their condition to the medical consultation, it would invariably be helpful to the medical practitioner for effective decision making.

To sum up, it is evident that online search for information on medical disorders can be a positive development as long as the general public receives trustworthy information.","[Fixed Criteria]
    ""
For “Task Response“:
- 9 (the highest band) means ""The prompt is  appropriately addressed and explored in depth. A clear and fully developed position is presented which directly answers the question/s. Ideas are relevant, fully extended and well supported. Any lapses in content or support are extremely rare.""
- 8 means ""The prompt is appropriately and sufficiently addressed. A clear and well-developed position is presented in response to the question/s. Ideas are relevant, well extended and supported. There may be occasional omissions or lapses in content.""
- 7 means ""The main parts of the prompt are appropriately addressed. A clear and developed position is presented. Main ideas are extended and supported but there may be a tendency to over-generalise or there may be a lack of focus and precision in supporting ideas/material.""
- 6 means ""The main parts of the prompt are addressed (though some may be more fully covered than others). An appropriate format is used. A position is presented that is directly relevant to the prompt, although the conclusions drawn may be unclear, unjustified or repetitive. Main ideas are relevant, but some may be insufficiently developed or may lack clarity, while some supporting arguments and evidence may be less relevant or inadequate.""
- 5 means ""The main parts of the prompt are incompletely addressed. The format may be inappropriate in places. The writer expresses a position, but the development is not always clear. Some main ideas are put forward, but they are limited and are not sufficiently developed and/or there may be irrelevant detail. There may be some repetition."" A
- 4 means ""The prompt is tackled in a minimal way, or the answer is tangential, possibly due to some misunderstanding of the prompt. The format may be inappropriate. A position is discernible, but the reader has to read carefully to find it. Main ideas are difficult to identify and such ideas that are identifiable may lack relevance, clarity and/or support. Large parts of the response may be repetitive.""
- 3 means ""No part of the prompt is adequately addressed, or the prompt has been misunderstood. No relevant position can be identified, and/or there is little direct response to the question/s. There are few ideas, and these may be irrelevant or insufficiently developed.""
- 2 means ""The content is barely related to the prompt. No position can be identified. There may be glimpses of one or two ideas without development.""
- 1 means ""Responses of 20 words or fewer are rated at Band 1. The content is wholly unrelated to the prompt.""
For ""Coherence and Cohesion"":
- 9 (the highest band) means ""The message can be followed effortlessly. Cohesion is used in such a way that it very rarely attracts attention. Any lapses in coherence or cohesion are minimal. Paragraphing is skilfully managed.
- 8 means ""The message can be followed with ease. Information and ideas are logically sequenced, and cohesion is well managed. Occasional lapses in coherence or cohesion may occur. Paragraphing is used sufficiently and appropriately.""

- 6 means ""Information and ideas are generally arranged coherently and there is a clear overall progression. Cohesive devices are used to some good effect but cohesion within and/or between sentences may be faulty or mechanical due to misuse, overuse or omission. The use of reference and substitution may lack flexibility or clarity and result in some repetition or error.
- 5 means ""Organisation is evident but is not wholly logical and there may be a lack of overall progression. Nevertheless, there is a sense of underlying coherence to the response. The relationship of ideas can be followed but the sentences are not fluently linked to each other. There may be limited/overuse of cohesive devices with some inaccuracy.

An awareness of style and collocation is evident, though inappropriacies occur. There are only a few errors in spelling and/or word formation, and they do not detract from overall clarity"".
- 6 means ""The resource is generally adequate and appropriate for the task. The meaning is generally clear in spite of a rather restricted range or a lack of precision in word choice. If the writer is a risk-taker, there will be a wider range of vocabulary used but higher degrees of inaccuracy or inappropriacy.There are some errors in spelling and/or word formation, but these do not impede communication.""

            [Task]
            You are an IELTS examiner, and you are required to evaluate an IELTS academic essay based on four specific criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. Each criterion should be rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 represents the highest level of proficiency and 1 the lowest.
            The detailed criteria is the text till the tag [Topic]. The essay topic is the text between [Topic] and the tag [Essay]. The essay that you need to evaluate is the text between the tag [Essay] and the tag [Task]. 
            
            ""Task Response"" evaluates how well the candidate fully answers the question and develops his or her ideas. Responses must be a minimum of 250 words. If the essay has 200-250 words, you should subtract 1 point from the Task Response score you would like to give to the student. If the essay has 20-200 words - subtract 2 points. If the essay has fewer than 20 words, you should assign a score of 1 for all criteria. If the essay is totally off-topic, you should assign a 2 to this criterion.
            ""Coherence and Cohesion"" evaluates the overall clarity and fluency of the message: how the response organizes and links information, ideas, and language. Coherence refers to the logical sequencing of ideas, while cohesion refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (for example, logical connectors, pronouns, and conjunctions) to clarify conceptual and referential relationships between and within sentences.
            ""Lexical Resource"" refers to the range of vocabulary the candidate has used, as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of that use in relation to the specific task. Academic style is welcomed, you should subtract 2 points if the essay is not academic. 
            ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy refers to the variety and accuracy of the candidate's grammar, including the use of punctuation.
            
            You will provide detailed feedback and scores for each criterion, scores are a must have. The feedback must include evidence from the original essay and reference the grading criteria to support your ideas.

Today people are surrounded by advertising. This affects what people think is important and has a negative impact on people’s lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"With the advent of the Internet, advertisements, originally displayed only on TV, billboards, posters and so on, are becoming increasingly ubiquitous and commonplace for the general public. In my view, this kind of impact could be both crucial and, on a certain level, detrimental.

On the one hand, this phenomenon could denote that although we have already had a diverse range of advertisement, people are still capable of inventing innovative approaches catering for all kinds of requirements of advertising. It is a symbol that demonstrates the creativity rooted in human beings. Apart from that, it also represents that the speed of spreading information is conspicuously escalating. More purposeful is, therefore, the fact that, besides booming of the advertising, it constitutes a major reason why people could be so prosperous in this digital age.

On the other hand, there are various unpleasant consequences as well. Firstly, with the omnipresent advertisement, it could potentially cause people to do impulsive shopping. Secondly, the advertisement, if regulated in a mismanaged method, could make people constantly feel uncomfortable or annoyed. In this sense, instead of being an instrumental tool to promote amenities, advertisements could be considered a hindrance when people are frequently blocked by them. Furthermore, it would cost one precious time to have to sift the helpful ad from a host of others.

In conclusion, as far as I am concerned, advertising is a beneficial phenomenon for all with a number of insignificant drawbacks. I believe that in the future we can improve the way advertising is done at present, and embrace the positive influence of advertising even further in the long run.","[Fixed Criteria]

"Some people think that spending a lot on holding wedding parties, birthday parties and other celebrations is just a waste of money. Others, however, think that these are necessary for individuals and the society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Throwing parties can be expensive. While some people do not find these fancy gatherings worth what they cost, others believe such events are important to both individuals and the society.

People choose to throw parties for a number of reasons. For starters, they can make better teams. Project kick-off parties are good opportunities to break the ice and help team members to know each other better. Celebrating a victory create a sense of success and belonging. Companies do not see parties as wastes of money and allocate budget to support such events; moreover, they often leave good memories. From our own experiences, we all have happy memories of our birthday parties when we were little. Every family has great photos took at family gatherings in their album. In addition, contrary to what some people believe that spending on parties is a waste of social resources, they actually create value, either by employing people in the party-planning business or by offering people better experiences.

The popularity of parties, however, causes some tension in the society. They are hard on introverted people who find themselves uncomfortable in the crowd. This is a clinic symptom which psychologists call it “social anxiety disorder”. There are other ways to celebrate important events that may have greater value for their cost. For instance, companies could send out gifts after successful projects and parents could take their children on family trips to celebrate birthdays.

In my opinion, while a party is a form of social event that brings many benefits to individuals and the society, other choices should also be considered, either to cut spending or to relieve the stress of those who are not fond of crowded celebrations.","[Fixed Criteria]

            [Task]
            You are an IELTS examiner, and you are required to evaluate an IELTS academic essay based on four specific criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. Each criterion should be rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 represents the highest level of proficiency and 1 the lowest.
            The detailed criteria is the text till the tag [Topic]. The essay topic is the text between [Topic] and the tag [Essay]. The essay that you need to evaluate is the text between the tag [Essay] and the tag [Task]. 
            
            ""Task Response"" evaluates how well the candidate fully answers the question and develops his or her ideas. Responses must be a minimum of 250 words. If the essay has 200-250 words, you should subtract 1 point from the Task Response score you would like to give to the student. If the essay has 20-200 words - subtract 2 points. If the essay has fewer than 20 words, you should assign a score of 1 for all criteria. If the essay is totally off-topic, you should assign a 2 to this criterion.
            ""Coherence and Cohesion"" evaluates the overall clarity and fluency of the message: how the response organizes and links information, ideas, and language. Coherence refers to the logical sequencing of ideas, while cohesion refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (for example, logical connectors, pronouns, and conjunctions) to clarify conceptual and referential relationships between and within sentences.
            ""Lexical Resource"" refers to the range of vocabulary the candidate has used, as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of that use in relation to the specific task. Academic style is welcomed, you should subtract 2 points if the essay is not academic. 
            ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy refers to the variety and accuracy of the candidate's grammar, including the use of punctuation.
            
            You will provide detailed feedback and scores for each criterion, scores are a must have. The feedback must include evidence from the original essay and reference the grading criteria to support your ideas.

"Public libraries should only provide books and should not waste their limited resources on expensive high-tech media such as software, videos or DVDs. Do you agree or disagree?","With the proliferation of high-tech media, some people hold that the public libraries would be rendered obsolete if they do not offer software, videos or DVDs to their users while other assert it’s only a waste of limited resources and the libraries should offer books only.

High-tech media is, in many ways, indeed superior to the books in terms of entertainment, attraction, and functionality. For instance, videos and DVDs function as a visual means to assist people to have a first-hand experience even though those people have not physically visited or seen the objects which are introduced in the books. Also, despite the audio-visual equipment would be prohibitive to install, the capital cost would be lowered by appealing to a sizable number of users.

More importantly, software could assist the library goers to access the Internet to update their knowledge on a daily basis; in contrast, books typically take multiple months to be published, which in turn render their contents outdated to some extent. In addition, upon learning that the computer literacy has become an essential skill recently, public libraries should take on the responsibility to educate its users how to operate a computer.

Furthermore, it is a common practice for most public libraries to share their resources via the Internet. In this way, even if one book of interest cannot be found in one library, the borrower still could locate the book from other libraries and then request the librarians to transfer the book to that particular library.

In conclusion, public libraries would benefit in multiple ways if they are equipped with the high-tech media.","[Fixed Criteria]

If the essay has 200-250 words, you should subtract 1 point from the Task Response score you would like to give to the student. If the essay has 20-200 words - subtract 2 points. If the essay has fewer than 20 words, you should assign a score of 1 for all criteria. If the essay is totally off-topic, you should assign a 2 to this criterion.
            ""Coherence and Cohesion"" evaluates the overall clarity and fluency of the message: how the response organizes and links information, ideas, and language. Coherence refers to the logical sequencing of ideas, while cohesion refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (for example, logical connectors, pronouns, and conjunctions) to clarify conceptual and referential relationships between and within sentences.
            ""Lexical Resource"" refers to the range of vocabulary the candidate has used, as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of that use in relation to the specific task. Academic style is welcomed, you should subtract 2 points if the essay is not academic. 
            ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy refers to the variety and accuracy of the candidate's grammar, including the use of punctuation.
            
            You will provide detailed feedback and scores for each criterion, scores are a must have. The feedback must include evidence from the original essay and reference the grading criteria to support your ideas.
            
            The output format should include:

"Some people claim that it is acceptable to use animals in medical research for the benefit of human beings, while others argue that it is wrong. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","People have different views on how medical research should be conducted and tested. Although many people support the use of animal experimentations for developing medicines, I personally believe that animal testing is morally wrong.

The main reason why some people value animal experimentations to conduct medical research is because animal testing has contributed to many life-saving cures and treatments. It is true that nearly every medical breakthrough in the last 100 years has resulted directly from research using animals. For example, experiments in which dogs had their pancreases removed led directly to the discovery of insulin, critical to saving the lives of diabetics. Furthermore, it is impossible to release new drugs to the market before proving it has no harm to humans and laboratory mice are appropriate research subjects because they are similar to human beings in many ways.

However, I support with people who consider medical development that involved the use of animals is cruel and unacceptable. I believe that the lives of all creatures should be respected and we, humans, have no right to suffer animals for our own benefits. Governments should invest in developing alternative methods that can replace using animal experimentations when doing medical research. For example, a software program can be developed to model a human immune system and new drugs can be tested on the software rather than animals. In this way, no animals will suffer from the medical tests and the society can still benefit from medical development.

In conclusion, although it is undoubtedly true that animal testing has helped scientists in drug developments and medical discoveries, I believe that the benefits to humans do not justify the suffering caused to animals and we should use alternative methods when doing medical research that do not involve animals suffering.","[Fixed Criteria]

Many museums charge for admission while others are free. Do you think the advantages of charging people for admission to museums outweigh the disadvantages?,"Museums are educational places which are beneficial for people in societies. However, these days, people have to pay an entrance fee to enter many museums. Although this phenomenon can lead to negative effects, I believe that there are for more positive effects.

It cannot be denied that price of tickets can bring about detrimental impacts to people, societies, and the museums themselves. From people’s perspective, they are discouraged to visit the museum and not able to access useful information and knowledge freely, particularly the poor because they cannot afford such amount. From societies’ perspective, citizens have fewer opportunities to access vitally significant places to learn history, science, art, and many other essential subjects. From museums’ perspective, they cannot attain one of their objectives to educate people. Moreover, they may have to close down as they lose more of their customers.

Despite aforementioned disadvantages, I am convinced that to charge for admission figures brings about a myriad of advantages. Firstly, museums will have money to operate which covers their business overhead such as personnel cost, equipments, electricity and water bills. Secondly, the museums can generate their own revenue to improve the place effectively to attract people, for example, to update their exhibits and keep the place clean and good-looking. Having visited many museums myself, I have learnt that many museums which sell tickets are better than those that do not charge for tickets in terms of places, information, and management.

In conclusion, although I recognize that the museums ticket sales can cause drawbacks to stakeholders in societies, I believe that museums should not remain free for all so as to be operated and developed most effectively.","[Fixed Criteria]

    ""Many museums charge for admission while others are free. Do you think the advantages of charging people for admission to museums outweigh the disadvantages?""

    [Essay]
    ""Museums are educational places which are beneficial for people in societies. However, these days, people have to pay an entrance fee to enter many museums. Although this phenomenon can lead to negative effects, I believe that there are for more positive effects.

It cannot be denied that price of tickets can bring about detrimental impacts to people, societies, and the museums themselves. From people’s perspective, they are discouraged to visit the museum and not able to access useful information and knowledge freely, particularly the poor because they cannot afford such amount. From societies’ perspective, citizens have fewer opportunities to access vitally significant places to learn history, science, art, and many other essential subjects. From museums’ perspective, they cannot attain one of their objectives to educate people. Moreover, they may have to close down as they lose more of their customers.

Despite aforementioned disadvantages, I am convinced that to charge for admission figures brings about a myriad of advantages. Firstly, museums will have money to operate which covers their business overhead such as personnel cost, equipments, electricity and water bills. Secondly, the museums can generate their own revenue to improve the place effectively to attract people, for example, to update their exhibits and keep the place clean and good-looking. Having visited many museums myself, I have learnt that many museums which sell tickets are better than those that do not charge for tickets in terms of places, information, and management.

In conclusion, although I recognize that the museums ticket sales can cause drawbacks to stakeholders in societies, I believe that museums should not remain free for all so as to be operated and developed most effectively.""
    
            [Task]
            You are an IELTS examiner, and you are required to evaluate an IELTS academic essay based on four specific criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. Each criterion should be rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 represents the highest level of proficiency and 1 the lowest.
            The detailed criteria is the text till the tag [Topic]. The essay topic is the text between [Topic] and the tag [Essay]. The essay that you need to evaluate is the text between the tag [Essay] and the tag [Task]. 
            
            ""Task Response"" evaluates how well the candidate fully answers the question and develops his or her ideas. Responses must be a minimum of 250 words. If the essay has 200-250 words, you should subtract 1 point from the Task Response score you would like to give to the student. If the essay has 20-200 words - subtract 2 points. If the essay has fewer than 20 words, you should assign a score of 1 for all criteria. If the essay is totally off-topic, you should assign a 2 to this criterion.
            ""Coherence and Cohesion"" evaluates the overall clarity and fluency of the message: how the response organizes and links information, ideas, and language. Coherence refers to the logical sequencing of ideas, while cohesion refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (for example, logical connectors, pronouns, and conjunctions) to clarify conceptual and referential relationships between and within sentences.
            ""Lexical Resource"" refers to the range of vocabulary the candidate has used, as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of that use in relation to the specific task. Academic style is welcomed, you should subtract 2 points if the essay is not academic. 
            ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy refers to the variety and accuracy of the candidate's grammar, including the use of punctuation.
            
            You will provide detailed feedback and scores for each criterion, scores are a must have. The feedback must include evidence from the original essay and reference the grading criteria to support your ideas.
            
            The output format should include:
            • ""Task Response feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes word count, overall correspondence between topic and essay, and unity of ideas in each paragraph. If the essay is off-topic, you should point this out with evidence.

Evidence includes use of linking words and number of paragraphs. Appropriate use of linking words and substitutions should be rewarded. The desired number of paragraphs is between 3 and 10. Essays that do not follow this structure should be penalized. 
            • ""Lexical Resource feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes number and example of B2, C1, C2 words based on CEFR complexity, noticeable word repetition, spelling mistakes. Appropriate and more complicated words will be rewarded; inappropriate word choice, oral style, and noticeable word repetition will be penalized. Spelling errors should be corrected. 
            • ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes grammar concepts used, grammar errors, use of complex sentences, including B2, C1, C2 sentences based on CEFR complexity, clauses, sentence length, punctuation errors. Complex sentences and the variety of grammatical resources used should be rewarded. Grammar and punctuation errors should be penalized and corrected.
            
            Based on the [Fixed Criteria] provided earlier and the feedback for each criterion, you are required to assign scores in the following format:
            • ""Task Response score"": An integer score from 1 to 9.

In many countries the proportion of older people is steadily increasing. What problems will this cause for individuals and society? Suggest some measures that could be taken to reduce the impact of ageing populations.,"It is true that nowadays people in industrialised nations can expect to live longer than ever before. Although there will undoubtedly be some negative consequences to this trend, societies can take steps to mitigate these potential problems.

As people live longer and the populations of developed countries grow older, several related problems can be anticipated. The main issue is that there will obviously be more people of retirement age who will be eligible to receive a pension. The proportion of younger, working adults will be smaller, and governments will therefore receive less money in taxes in relation to the size of the population. In other words, an ageing population will mean a greater tax burden  of working adults. Further pressures will include a rise in the demand for healthcare, and the fact young adults will increasingly have to look after their elderly relatives.

There are several actions that governments could take to solve the problems described above. Firstly, a simple solution would be to increase the retirement age for working adults, perhaps from 65 to 70. Nowadays, people of this age tend to be healthy enough to continue a productive working life. A second measure would be for governments to encourage immigration in order to increase the number of working adults who pay taxes. Finally, money from national budgets will need to be taken from other areas and spent for vital healthcare, accommodation and transport facilities for the rising numbers of senior citizens.

In conclusion, various measures can be taken to tackle the problems that are certain to arise as the populations of countries grow older.","[Fixed Criteria]

Some believe that people should not continue to work once they reach the age of retirement. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples from your experience.,"In recent years, with the improvement in healthcare sector and better living standards, people are able to live longer and contribute to the economic progress of a nation more, compared to the past. Some see this as an entirely positive development, while others point out the drawbacks of working beyond the retirement age.

Delaying retirement enables individuals to actively contribute to the society. On a personal level, working past retirement age provides an avenue for individuals to remain not only physically but also mentally active. Moreover, this option empowers the ageing population to be financially independent and economically self-sustainable past retirement age. In countries with growing ageing population such as Singapore, for instance, citizens are given an option to work beyond their retirement age based on the demands of their job and their capability to handle these tasks. Hence, working beyond retirement age empowers workers, ensures economic progression of the nation, and alleviates the challenges faced by an ageing population.

On the flip side, working beyond the retirement age may result in adverse health impacts on workers and a decrease in productivity levels. In Japan, the suicide rates have recently been increasing due to rising stress levels at work faced by the ageing population who are pushed to work beyond their optimal capacity. Escalating stress levels from work leads to various health complications putting a strain on the healthcare system. Hence, working beyond retirement age may worsen the overall welfare of individuals and adversely impact the economy.

To sum up, though working beyond retirement age imposes health hazards leading to reduction in productivity levels, it seems to me that the benefits far outweigh the disadvantages. In my opinion, by assessing the capability of individuals and tailoring their jobs to their health profile, firms and companies should actively involve their workers to be productive beyond their retirement age.","[Fixed Criteria]

    ""Some believe that people should not continue to work once they reach the age of retirement. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples from your experience.""

    [Essay]
    ""In recent years, with the improvement in healthcare sector and better living standards, people are able to live longer and contribute to the economic progress of a nation more, compared to the past. Some see this as an entirely positive development, while others point out the drawbacks of working beyond the retirement age.

Delaying retirement enables individuals to actively contribute to the society. On a personal level, working past retirement age provides an avenue for individuals to remain not only physically but also mentally active. Moreover, this option empowers the ageing population to be financially independent and economically self-sustainable past retirement age. In countries with growing ageing population such as Singapore, for instance, citizens are given an option to work beyond their retirement age based on the demands of their job and their capability to handle these tasks. Hence, working beyond retirement age empowers workers, ensures economic progression of the nation, and alleviates the challenges faced by an ageing population.

On the flip side, working beyond the retirement age may result in adverse health impacts on workers and a decrease in productivity levels. In Japan, the suicide rates have recently been increasing due to rising stress levels at work faced by the ageing population who are pushed to work beyond their optimal capacity. Escalating stress levels from work leads to various health complications putting a strain on the healthcare system. Hence, working beyond retirement age may worsen the overall welfare of individuals and adversely impact the economy.

To sum up, though working beyond retirement age imposes health hazards leading to reduction in productivity levels, it seems to me that the benefits far outweigh the disadvantages. In my opinion, by assessing the capability of individuals and tailoring their jobs to their health profile, firms and companies should actively involve their workers to be productive beyond their retirement age.""
    
            [Task]
            You are an IELTS examiner, and you are required to evaluate an IELTS academic essay based on four specific criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. Each criterion should be rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 represents the highest level of proficiency and 1 the lowest.
            The detailed criteria is the text till the tag [Topic]. The essay topic is the text between [Topic] and the tag [Essay]. The essay that you need to evaluate is the text between the tag [Essay] and the tag [Task]. 
            
            ""Task Response"" evaluates how well the candidate fully answers the question and develops his or her ideas. Responses must be a minimum of 250 words. If the essay has 200-250 words, you should subtract 1 point from the Task Response score you would like to give to the student. If the essay has 20-200 words - subtract 2 points. If the essay has fewer than 20 words, you should assign a score of 1 for all criteria. If the essay is totally off-topic, you should assign a 2 to this criterion.
            ""Coherence and Cohesion"" evaluates the overall clarity and fluency of the message: how the response organizes and links information, ideas, and language. Coherence refers to the logical sequencing of ideas, while cohesion refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (for example, logical connectors, pronouns, and conjunctions) to clarify conceptual and referential relationships between and within sentences.
            ""Lexical Resource"" refers to the range of vocabulary the candidate has used, as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of that use in relation to the specific task. Academic style is welcomed, you should subtract 2 points if the essay is not academic. 
            ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy refers to the variety and accuracy of the candidate's grammar, including the use of punctuation.
            
            You will provide detailed feedback and scores for each criterion, scores are a must have. The feedback must include evidence from the original essay and reference the grading criteria to support your ideas.

Evidence includes use of linking words and number of paragraphs. Appropriate use of linking words and substitutions should be rewarded. The desired number of paragraphs is between 3 and 10. Essays that do not follow this structure should be penalized. 
            • ""Lexical Resource feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes number and example of B2, C1, C2 words based on CEFR complexity, noticeable word repetition, spelling mistakes. Appropriate and more complicated words will be rewarded; inappropriate word choice, oral style, and noticeable word repetition will be penalized. Spelling errors should be corrected. 
            • ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes grammar concepts used, grammar errors, use of complex sentences, including B2, C1, C2 sentences based on CEFR complexity, clauses, sentence length, punctuation errors. Complex sentences and the variety of grammatical resources used should be rewarded. Grammar and punctuation errors should be penalized and corrected.
            
            Based on the [Fixed Criteria] provided earlier and the feedback for each criterion, you are required to assign scores in the following format:

Nowadays more and more people want to live by themselves. What are the reasons? Is it a positive or negative trend?,"These days a vast majority of people want to lead an independent life. The fundamental reason lies in people’s educational qualifications that fuel their craving for freedom in life. This can be seen as a positive trend because living alone is likely to nurture a mature mindset at early stages of one’s life.

Many people are well educated to stand up on their own. Tertiary education broadens their horizons, and they wish to experience freedom of life. With a very good educational background it becomes easier to find a well-paid job, and with lucrative income they gain confidence to lead an independent life, thereby achieving their goals. For example, engineering graduates can find a job in another town and their salary is enough for them to move and settle down there. This enables them to move away from their family and live on their own.

Living alone helps one to develop maturity, which can be seen as a positive impact on individuals and the society as a whole. Being independent means young people have to face life challenges alone and going through this process improves their resilience. They become more responsible, as they have to take care of themselves and develop budgeting skills and saving habits, for their future needs as well. Better planning of their finances nurtures the custom of wise spending at early stages of adult life.

In conclusion, the reason why many people wish to live independently these days is because their education level gives them both the awareness of freedom in life and means of achieving it. Since living alone promotes one’s maturity, it seems to be a positive trend in today’s society.","[Fixed Criteria]

"Nowadays in many countries women have full time jobs. Therefore, it is logical to share household tasks evenly between men and women. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","Nowadays an ever-increasing number of women work full time, and in this reality it is widely believed that house chores should be shared between men and women equally. I strongly agree with this statement.

One of the reasons for sharing housework between males and females is to promote gender equality. A stereotype that has existed a long time is that females ought to stay home, taking care of the family once they got married. This includes looking after the children and doing all of the housework, which is fairly labour-intensive. However, this approach could have quite a few disadvantages. It would render women less able of keeping abreast of what is happening in the job market, thus forming a lifestyle where they might find it arduous to step into the society again. To avoid this, many women are willing to get back into the workforce soon after their maternity leave, and once they do, it makes sense that their husbands should share part of the household chores, to fulfill their family responsibilities.

Nevertheless, we cannot be oblivious of several drawbacks of this trend. One potential downside is that men are less experienced in dealing with household tasks. This is because many seldom take an active role in doing housework, according to customs of many countries. As a result, they may end up doing household tasks in a less than perfect way, which could contribute to some unnecessary quarrels between partners, hindering their family bond. However, the likelihood of this happening isn’t very high, because wives can offer some tips or guidance to their husbands when they learn how to share house chores such as mopping floors or doing laundry.

To sum up, although some conflicts might be triggered when equally sharing the duties of household tasks, the benefits of this trend are relatively oblivious.","[Fixed Criteria]

    ""Nowadays in many countries women have full time jobs. Therefore, it is logical to share household tasks evenly between men and women. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?""

    [Essay]
    ""Nowadays an ever-increasing number of women work full time, and in this reality it is widely believed that house chores should be shared between men and women equally. I strongly agree with this statement.

One of the reasons for sharing housework between males and females is to promote gender equality. A stereotype that has existed a long time is that females ought to stay home, taking care of the family once they got married. This includes looking after the children and doing all of the housework, which is fairly labour-intensive. However, this approach could have quite a few disadvantages. It would render women less able of keeping abreast of what is happening in the job market, thus forming a lifestyle where they might find it arduous to step into the society again. To avoid this, many women are willing to get back into the workforce soon after their maternity leave, and once they do, it makes sense that their husbands should share part of the household chores, to fulfill their family responsibilities.

Nevertheless, we cannot be oblivious of several drawbacks of this trend. One potential downside is that men are less experienced in dealing with household tasks. This is because many seldom take an active role in doing housework, according to customs of many countries. As a result, they may end up doing household tasks in a less than perfect way, which could contribute to some unnecessary quarrels between partners, hindering their family bond. However, the likelihood of this happening isn’t very high, because wives can offer some tips or guidance to their husbands when they learn how to share house chores such as mopping floors or doing laundry.

To sum up, although some conflicts might be triggered when equally sharing the duties of household tasks, the benefits of this trend are relatively oblivious.""

            You are an IELTS examiner, and you are required to evaluate an IELTS academic essay based on four specific criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. Each criterion should be rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 represents the highest level of proficiency and 1 the lowest.
            The detailed criteria is the text till the tag [Topic]. The essay topic is the text between [Topic] and the tag [Essay]. The essay that you need to evaluate is the text between the tag [Essay] and the tag [Task]. 
            
            ""Task Response"" evaluates how well the candidate fully answers the question and develops his or her ideas. Responses must be a minimum of 250 words. If the essay has 200-250 words, you should subtract 1 point from the Task Response score you would like to give to the student. If the essay has 20-200 words - subtract 2 points. If the essay has fewer than 20 words, you should assign a score of 1 for all criteria. If the essay is totally off-topic, you should assign a 2 to this criterion.
            ""Coherence and Cohesion"" evaluates the overall clarity and fluency of the message: how the response organizes and links information, ideas, and language. Coherence refers to the logical sequencing of ideas, while cohesion refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (for example, logical connectors, pronouns, and conjunctions) to clarify conceptual and referential relationships between and within sentences.
            ""Lexical Resource"" refers to the range of vocabulary the candidate has used, as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of that use in relation to the specific task. Academic style is welcomed, you should subtract 2 points if the essay is not academic. 
            ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy refers to the variety and accuracy of the candidate's grammar, including the use of punctuation.

Evidence includes use of linking words and number of paragraphs. Appropriate use of linking words and substitutions should be rewarded. The desired number of paragraphs is between 3 and 10. Essays that do not follow this structure should be penalized. 
            • ""Lexical Resource feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes number and example of B2, C1, C2 words based on CEFR complexity, noticeable word repetition, spelling mistakes. Appropriate and more complicated words will be rewarded; inappropriate word choice, oral style, and noticeable word repetition will be penalized. Spelling errors should be corrected. 
            • ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes grammar concepts used, grammar errors, use of complex sentences, including B2, C1, C2 sentences based on CEFR complexity, clauses, sentence length, punctuation errors. Complex sentences and the variety of grammatical resources used should be rewarded. Grammar and punctuation errors should be penalized and corrected.

"Some believe that modern technology is increasing the gap between rich and poor people, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","There is no doubt that modern technology is reshaping our planet and affecting every aspect of human lives. From a social perspective, many people argue that the gap between the upper class and lower classes is widening as a result of technological advancements. Others, however, believe the opposite.

There are several reasons why one could think that the wealth inequality is, indeed, increasing. The most common reason is the automation.  Driven by technology, automation reduces the need for manual labour. As a result, less work opportunities are available for unskilled people. With each iteration of the cycle the competition increases and wages decrease. Secondly, technology has increased the minimum level of needs that should be satisfied. Nowadays, everybody should have a mobile phone and an internet connection, including the poor. This increases the monetary burden on them as they must borrow to cover these new needs.

However, I firmly believe that the aforementioned opinion is ludicrous. The most obvious reason is that modern technology has facilitated the road to riches in an unprecedented manner. For instance, many of the internet billionaires are from lower and middle classes. Moreover, the major leaps in agricultural technologies has magnified food production. As a result, food has become more affordable and available. Finally, leveraging technology has dramatically increased workers’ productivity. Consequently, compensations and salaries have increased.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that technology could possibly narrow the difference between social classes. Increased food production, opportunities and productivity are just few examples of technology’s contribution to bridging the wealth gap.","[Fixed Criteria]

Many people believe that international tourism is a bad thing for their countries. What are the reasons for this? What can be done to change this negative attitude towards international tourism?,"Many individuals think that foreign tourism brings negative effects to their countries. There are several reasons for such negative attitude towards international travelers. However, a couple of solutions could be adopted to handle this situation, as will now be discussed.

International tourists are often criticized for their contribution to the environmental degradation. It has continuously been noticed that they throw rubbish in their surroundings irresponsibly, which increases the amount of litter everywhere, despite all attempts to reduce waste produced by the local community. This contributes to water, air and soil contamination.

Furthermore, foreign tourism has a harmful influence on traditional customs and indigenous practices of host countries because many tourists are careless and insensitive about the emotions and feelings of local residents. For instance, in India, some foreign travelers wear inappropriate clothes or expose too much of skin when they visit sacred places, which leads to some negative attitude and irritation in the local public.

However, this situation can be improved adopting different solutions which could be handled by the government. The government should explain the benefits of international tourism which contributes to the development of local residents. They not only spend money in shops and restaurants but also create jobs in service industries, and this aspect could be publicized. Additionally, the government should increase the awareness among the foreigners through different media such as roadside billboards and advertisements, and tourists should be encouraged to get rid of rubbish correctly.

In conclusion, the inhospitable feeling that the local people have for international tourists can be explained in many ways. However, in my opinion, the government’s involvement is essential to change the negative attitude by citing various advantages of international tourism to their country and raising awareness among tourists in order to protect local habitats.","[Fixed Criteria]

    ""Many people believe that international tourism is a bad thing for their countries. What are the reasons for this? What can be done to change this negative attitude towards international tourism?""

    [Essay]
    ""Many individuals think that foreign tourism brings negative effects to their countries. There are several reasons for such negative attitude towards international travelers. However, a couple of solutions could be adopted to handle this situation, as will now be discussed.

International tourists are often criticized for their contribution to the environmental degradation. It has continuously been noticed that they throw rubbish in their surroundings irresponsibly, which increases the amount of litter everywhere, despite all attempts to reduce waste produced by the local community. This contributes to water, air and soil contamination.

Furthermore, foreign tourism has a harmful influence on traditional customs and indigenous practices of host countries because many tourists are careless and insensitive about the emotions and feelings of local residents. For instance, in India, some foreign travelers wear inappropriate clothes or expose too much of skin when they visit sacred places, which leads to some negative attitude and irritation in the local public.

However, this situation can be improved adopting different solutions which could be handled by the government. The government should explain the benefits of international tourism which contributes to the development of local residents. They not only spend money in shops and restaurants but also create jobs in service industries, and this aspect could be publicized. Additionally, the government should increase the awareness among the foreigners through different media such as roadside billboards and advertisements, and tourists should be encouraged to get rid of rubbish correctly.

In conclusion, the inhospitable feeling that the local people have for international tourists can be explained in many ways. However, in my opinion, the government’s involvement is essential to change the negative attitude by citing various advantages of international tourism to their country and raising awareness among tourists in order to protect local habitats.""
    
            [Task]
            You are an IELTS examiner, and you are required to evaluate an IELTS academic essay based on four specific criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. Each criterion should be rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 represents the highest level of proficiency and 1 the lowest.
            The detailed criteria is the text till the tag [Topic]. The essay topic is the text between [Topic] and the tag [Essay]. The essay that you need to evaluate is the text between the tag [Essay] and the tag [Task]. 
            
            ""Task Response"" evaluates how well the candidate fully answers the question and develops his or her ideas. Responses must be a minimum of 250 words.

In many countries senior positions have higher salaries compared to those of young workers of the same company. Some people think this isn’t justified. Do you agree or disagree?,"While some believe that rewarding those in managerial positions with higher pay packets is appropriate, not everyone agrees with this view. Personally, I am leaning towards the latter position due to negative impacts caused by significant difference in salaries within a company.

For one, executive officers should know that higher than sufficient salaries are not necessary. Indeed, the higher the remuneration they receive, the more likely the company to suffer from devoid of financial capability. Furthermore, they often gain powers that money can’t buy. For instance, they often make important decisions over how to make their company thrive. They are also entitled to allocate company’s budget and designate tasks to other workers. In lieu of these non-financial entitlements, they should refrain from earning more than reasonable amounts as  salaries.

Unreasonably high salaries granted to the executives can also afflict other employees. In fact, it is foreseeable that many employees would feel powerless or even disappointment when they find out about the huge salary gap between the executive officers’ and theirs. Accordingly, some may leave the company, and others may go on to strike and demand a pay increase. However, those actions hardly be productive nor worthy to do. Therefore, unfair salary systems like this would yield unhealthy working environment for both employers and employees.

In conclusion, I oppose to provide those in managerial roles with obscene amounts of compensation because it can cost the company its prosperity and discourage other employees to work hard. Thus it is recommended for the company to decide on the salaries of executive officers and general workers by adopting a more motivating salary system.","[Fixed Criteria]

But how do we determine if a person is the best fit? Advocates of conventional recruitment methods opine that this candidate must have sufficient experience and qualifications needed for that job. Nevertheless, some people argue that candidates’ personal qualities cannot be ignored. In my view, both components are of equal importance.

To begin with, the conventional approach of checking potential workers’ qualifications via their resumes, LinkedIn profiles, issued qualifications and certifications from authorised organisations is vital. Apparently, whenever we submit a job application, we are always required to attach a CV while a cover letter is optional. Without a decent qualification, even if that candidate’s personal characteristics are suitable, the enterprise will need to carry out lots of skill trainings eventually.

On the other hand, occasionally during an interview some HR officers ignore the significance of assessing how candidates’ individual qualities can fit in the company. Employers should assess not only candidates’ qualifications but also their enabling skills, ethics and value propositions. The more an employee’s personal qualities fit in a company’s culture and values, the more he or she is motivated to contribute to that company’s vision. KPMG is a great example of evaluating candidates’ personal qualifications and skills by utilising a game-based assessment process, followed by a video interview. This methodology enables a comprehensive assessment, and is embraced by many companies nowadays.

To summarise, employers should assess both personal characteristics and formal qualifications when recruiting people as each of these elements has its own vital contribution to make in talent-seeking enterprises.","[Fixed Criteria]
    ""
For “Task Response“:
- 9 (the highest band) means ""The prompt is  appropriately addressed and explored in depth. A clear and fully developed position is presented which directly answers the question/s. Ideas are relevant, fully extended and well supported. Any lapses in content or support are extremely rare.""
- 8 means ""The prompt is appropriately and sufficiently addressed. A clear and well-developed position is presented in response to the question/s. Ideas are relevant, well extended and supported. There may be occasional omissions or lapses in content.""
- 7 means ""The main parts of the prompt are appropriately addressed. A clear and developed position is presented. Main ideas are extended and supported but there may be a tendency to over-generalise or there may be a lack of focus and precision in supporting ideas/material.""
- 6 means ""The main parts of the prompt are addressed (though some may be more fully covered than others). An appropriate format is used. A position is presented that is directly relevant to the prompt, although the conclusions drawn may be unclear, unjustified or repetitive. Main ideas are relevant, but some may be insufficiently developed or may lack clarity, while some supporting arguments and evidence may be less relevant or inadequate.""
- 5 means ""The main parts of the prompt are incompletely addressed. The format may be inappropriate in places. The writer expresses a position, but the development is not always clear. Some main ideas are put forward, but they are limited and are not sufficiently developed and/or there may be irrelevant detail. There may be some repetition."" A
- 4 means ""The prompt is tackled in a minimal way, or the answer is tangential, possibly due to some misunderstanding of the prompt. The format may be inappropriate. A position is discernible, but the reader has to read carefully to find it. Main ideas are difficult to identify and such ideas that are identifiable may lack relevance, clarity and/or support. Large parts of the response may be repetitive.""
- 3 means ""No part of the prompt is adequately addressed, or the prompt has been misunderstood. No relevant position can be identified, and/or there is little direct response to the question/s. There are few ideas, and these may be irrelevant or insufficiently developed.""
- 2 means ""The content is barely related to the prompt. No position can be identified. There may be glimpses of one or two ideas without development.""
- 1 means ""Responses of 20 words or fewer are rated at Band 1. The content is wholly unrelated to the prompt.""
For ""Coherence and Cohesion"":
- 9 (the highest band) means ""The message can be followed effortlessly. Cohesion is used in such a way that it very rarely attracts attention. Any lapses in coherence or cohesion are minimal. Paragraphing is skilfully managed.
- 8 means ""The message can be followed with ease. Information and ideas are logically sequenced, and cohesion is well managed. Occasional lapses in coherence or cohesion may occur. Paragraphing is used sufficiently and appropriately.""
- 7 means ""Information and ideas are logically organised and there is a clear progression throughout the response. A few lapses may occur. A range of cohesive devices including reference and substitution is used flexibly but with some inaccuracies or some over/under use""
- 6 means ""Information and ideas are generally arranged coherently and there is a clear overall progression. Cohesive devices are used to some good effect but cohesion within and/or between sentences may be faulty or mechanical due to misuse, overuse or omission. The use of reference and substitution may lack flexibility or clarity and result in some repetition or error.
- 5 means ""Organisation is evident but is not wholly logical and there may be a lack of overall progression. Nevertheless, there is a sense of underlying coherence to the response. The relationship of ideas can be followed but the sentences are not fluently linked to each other. There may be limited/overuse of cohesive devices with some inaccuracy. The writing may be repetitive due to inadequate and/or inaccurate use of reference and substitution.""
- 4 means ""Information and ideas are evident but not arranged coherently, and there is no clear progression within the response. Relationships between ideas can be unclear and/or inadequately marked. There is some use of basic cohesive devices, which may be inaccurate or repetitive. There is inaccurate use or a lack of substitution or referencing.""
- 3 means ""There is no apparent logical organisation. Ideas are discernible but difficult to relate to each other. Minimal use of sequencers or cohesive devices. Those used do not necessarily indicate a logical relationship between ideas. There is difficulty in identifying referencing.""
- 2 means ""There is little relevant message, or the entire response may be off-topic. There is little evidence of control of organisational features.""
- 1 means ""Responses of 20 words or fewer are rated at Band 1. The writing fails to communicate any message and appears to be by a virtual non-writer.""
For ""Lexical Resource"":
- 9 (the highest score) means ""Full flexibility and precise use are evident within the scope of the task. A wide range of vocabulary is used accurately and appropriately with very natural and sophisticated control of lexical features. Minor errors in spelling and word formation are extremely rare and have minimal impact on communication.""
- 8 means ""A wide resource is fluently and flexibly used to convey precise meanings within the scope of the task. There is skilful use of uncommon and/or 
idiomatic items when appropriate, despite occasional inaccuracies in word choice and collocation. Occasional errors in spelling and/or word formation may occur, but have minimal impact on communication.""
- 7 means ""The resource is sufficient to allow some flexibility and precision. There is some ability to use less common and/or idiomatic items. An awareness of style and collocation is evident, though inappropriacies occur. There are only a few errors in spelling and/or word formation, and they do not detract from overall clarity"".
- 6 means ""The resource is generally adequate and appropriate for the task. The meaning is generally clear in spite of a rather restricted range or a lack of precision in word choice. If the writer is a risk-taker, there will be a wider range of vocabulary used but higher degrees of inaccuracy or inappropriacy.There are some errors in spelling and/or word formation, but these do not impede communication.""
- 5 means ""The resource is limited but minimally adequate for the task. Simple vocabulary may be used accurately but the range does not permit much variation in expression. There may be frequent lapses in the appropriacy of word choice, and a lack of flexibility is apparent in frequent simplifications and/or repetitions. Errors in spelling and/or word formation may be noticeable and may cause some difficulty for the reader.""
- 4 means ""The resource is limited and inadequate for or unrelated to the task. Vocabulary is basic and may be used repetitively. There may be inappropriate use of lexical chunks (e.g. memorised phrases, formulaic language and/or language from the input material). Inappropriate word choice and/or errors in word formation and/or in spelling may impede meaning.""
- 3 means ""The resource is inadequate (which may be due to the response being significantly underlength).Possible over-dependence on input material or memorised language. Control of word choice and/or spelling is very limited, and errors predominate. These errors may severely impede meaning"".
- 2 means ""The resource is extremely limited with few recognisable strings, apart from memorised phrases. There is no apparent control of word formation and/or spelling"".
- 1 means ""Responses of 20 words or fewer are rated at Band 1. No resource is apparent, except for a few isolated words.""
For ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy"":

- 7 means ""A variety of complex structures is used with  some flexibility and accuracy. Grammar and punctuation are generally well  controlled, and error-free sentences are  frequent. A few errors in grammar may persist, but  these do not impede communication.""
- 6 means ""A mix of simple and complex sentence  forms is used but flexibility is limited. Examples of more complex structures are  not marked by the same level of accuracy  as in simple structures. Errors in grammar and punctuation occur,  but rarely impede communication"".
- 5 means ""The range of structures is limited and  rather repetitive. Although complex sentences are  attempted, they tend to be faulty, and the  greatest accuracy is achieved on simple  sentences. Grammatical errors may be frequent and  cause some difficulty for the reader. Punctuation may be faulty.""
- 4 means ""A very limited range of structures is  used. Subordinate clauses are rare and  simple sentences predominate. Some structures are produced accurately  but grammatical errors are frequent and  may impede meaning. Punctuation is often faulty or inadequate"".
- 3 means ""Sentence forms are attempted, but  errors in grammar and punctuation  predominate (except in memorised phrases or those taken from the input  material). This prevents most meaning  from coming through. Length may be insufficient to provide  evidence of control of sentence forms.""

            [Task]
            You are an IELTS examiner, and you are required to evaluate an IELTS academic essay based on four specific criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. Each criterion should be rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 represents the highest level of proficiency and 1 the lowest.
            The detailed criteria is the text till the tag [Topic]. The essay topic is the text between [Topic] and the tag [Essay]. The essay that you need to evaluate is the text between the tag [Essay] and the tag [Task]. 
            
            ""Task Response"" evaluates how well the candidate fully answers the question and develops his or her ideas. Responses must be a minimum of 250 words. If the essay has 200-250 words, you should subtract 1 point from the Task Response score you would like to give to the student. If the essay has 20-200 words - subtract 2 points. If the essay has fewer than 20 words, you should assign a score of 1 for all criteria. If the essay is totally off-topic, you should assign a 2 to this criterion.
            ""Coherence and Cohesion"" evaluates the overall clarity and fluency of the message: how the response organizes and links information, ideas, and language. Coherence refers to the logical sequencing of ideas, while cohesion refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (for example, logical connectors, pronouns, and conjunctions) to clarify conceptual and referential relationships between and within sentences.
            ""Lexical Resource"" refers to the range of vocabulary the candidate has used, as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of that use in relation to the specific task. Academic style is welcomed, you should subtract 2 points if the essay is not academic. 
            ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy refers to the variety and accuracy of the candidate's grammar, including the use of punctuation.
            
            You will provide detailed feedback and scores for each criterion, scores are a must have. The feedback must include evidence from the original essay and reference the grading criteria to support your ideas.
            
            The output format should include:
            • ""Task Response feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes word count, overall correspondence between topic and essay, and unity of ideas in each paragraph. If the essay is off-topic, you should point this out with evidence.

Evidence includes use of linking words and number of paragraphs. Appropriate use of linking words and substitutions should be rewarded. The desired number of paragraphs is between 3 and 10. Essays that do not follow this structure should be penalized. 
            • ""Lexical Resource feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes number and example of B2, C1, C2 words based on CEFR complexity, noticeable word repetition, spelling mistakes. Appropriate and more complicated words will be rewarded; inappropriate word choice, oral style, and noticeable word repetition will be penalized. Spelling errors should be corrected. 
            • ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes grammar concepts used, grammar errors, use of complex sentences, including B2, C1, C2 sentences based on CEFR complexity, clauses, sentence length, punctuation errors. Complex sentences and the variety of grammatical resources used should be rewarded. Grammar and punctuation errors should be penalized and corrected.
            
            Based on the [Fixed Criteria] provided earlier and the feedback for each criterion, you are required to assign scores in the following format:

"Many parents encourage young people to leave home when they become older, while others think they should stay at home with the family. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","With the tremendous influence of modernisation, remarkable changes have taken place in the family structure to such an extent that nowadays, youngsters are motivated by their parents to live alone as they grow up. However, some people are of the view that it is more practical for a youngster to live with their family.

On the one hand, there are many positive aspects to youths living away from their parents at young age. This provides the opportunity to young people to live a life on their own terms and make any decisions without the interference of their parents. Besides, living alone not only makes them independent but also makes them self-reliant, which is a crucial life skill to their successful career. For instance, managing all the house chores such as cleaning, paying bills, cooking and so on will make them well experienced at learning and managing diverse activities and will also boost their confidence.

On the other hand, there is no denying the fact that youngsters living away from their family may find themselves in circumstances that may adversely affect their life. Naïve and inexperienced young people in the absence of parental supervision are more likely to fall prey to bad influence and dangerous activities, such as drugs or alcohol consumption, which may jeopardise their career or lead them astray from moral values. However, this situation is less likely to take place with youngsters still living with their parents. Besides, emotional bonding and family relationships can be maintained better if everyone is living together under one roof.

In my opinion, although encouraging youngsters to live alone may lead them to learn various life skills, negative aspects and risks associated with living alone can far outweigh the benefits.","[Fixed Criteria]

Today’s schools should teach their students how to survive financially in the world today. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"In schools, students learn to analyse literature, calculate using trigonometry and understand how photosynthesis works, but often students are inexperienced and helpless after graduation when encountering the real world. It is therefore argued that schools should teach their students how to survive financially in the world.

This topic is difficult, though. Many educators believe that a school is supposed to teach students in subjects that they will most probably not encounter again post-graduation, so that teachers can develop open-minded and well-informed individuals. At the same time, it can be argued that schools should impart skills that would be applicable in everyday life. Mathematics, for example, is supposed to not only communicate actual mathematics skills, but also teach logic to students. However, schools are supposed to prepare the youths for their lives following high school. Currently this goal is not fully met, as often students are unable to handle their finances sensibly and therefore can often face significant problems. Schools that teach students how to survive financially could change this.


This significant shift in the ideology of education is unlikely to take place soon, as the education system has been in place for too long to be easily changed. Also a change of this scale would be costly, as teachers would have to be trained and a syllabus for this potential subject would have to be created. However, in some countries, for example Germany, a community subject is available in which politics and finances are discussed. This leaves students from Germany in a better situation to deal with finances in their lives.

In conclusion, I believe that training school students in financial matters would be very useful. Adding new content to the syllabus would require a significant amount of money, but the entire community would benefit from students being better prepared for adult life.","[Fixed Criteria]

            [Task]
            You are an IELTS examiner, and you are required to evaluate an IELTS academic essay based on four specific criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. Each criterion should be rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 represents the highest level of proficiency and 1 the lowest.
            The detailed criteria is the text till the tag [Topic]. The essay topic is the text between [Topic] and the tag [Essay]. The essay that you need to evaluate is the text between the tag [Essay] and the tag [Task]. 
            
            ""Task Response"" evaluates how well the candidate fully answers the question and develops his or her ideas. Responses must be a minimum of 250 words. If the essay has 200-250 words, you should subtract 1 point from the Task Response score you would like to give to the student. If the essay has 20-200 words - subtract 2 points. If the essay has fewer than 20 words, you should assign a score of 1 for all criteria. If the essay is totally off-topic, you should assign a 2 to this criterion.
            ""Coherence and Cohesion"" evaluates the overall clarity and fluency of the message: how the response organizes and links information, ideas, and language. Coherence refers to the logical sequencing of ideas, while cohesion refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (for example, logical connectors, pronouns, and conjunctions) to clarify conceptual and referential relationships between and within sentences.
            ""Lexical Resource"" refers to the range of vocabulary the candidate has used, as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of that use in relation to the specific task. Academic style is welcomed, you should subtract 2 points if the essay is not academic. 
            ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy refers to the variety and accuracy of the candidate's grammar, including the use of punctuation.
            
            You will provide detailed feedback and scores for each criterion, scores are a must have. The feedback must include evidence from the original essay and reference the grading criteria to support your ideas.

"In some countries, boys and girls are educated separately after the age of about ten years old. Discuss this view and give your opinion.

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.","In many countries around the world, boys and girls are educated together. There is a group of countries, however, that educate boys and girls separately. This is frequently done on religious grounds, but not always. Having such a system can produce various advantages and disadvantages.

One of the principal reasons for educating boys and girls separately is that, if they are together, they can distract each other. After puberty, boys can be strongly attracted to girls and vice versa, and this can result in disruptive conduct in the classroom as, for example, they show off to one another. Separating boys and girls can therefore have the distinct advantage of reducing this disturbing behaviour. However, some teachers have pointed out that this model does not always work, and that separated boys and girls are equally disruptive in class, and sometimes more so. These teachers say that having the opposite sex in the classroom can actually improve behaviour.


Many educators also believe that boys and girls have different learning styles and needs. Separating boys and girls can allow teachers to address these needs more easily. There is also a belief that single sex schools allow gender stereotypes to be challenged and therefore education aspirations can be broadened.

A major disadvantage of separating boys and girls in education is that the children miss important formative behavioural development when they do not have interaction with the other gender on a regular basis. This can lead to shyness and, more seriously, dysfunctional relationships later in life. Some people also feel that mixed sex schools can promote gender stereotypes rather than reducing them.

In conclusion, I feel that children should be educated all together, although I would respect a system in which they are separated due to religious beliefs. My personal opinion is that different genders should learn to interact together from an early age, as this would allow them to develop healthy working relationships with each other.","[Fixed Criteria]

Each criterion should be rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 represents the highest level of proficiency and 1 the lowest.
            The detailed criteria is the text till the tag [Topic]. The essay topic is the text between [Topic] and the tag [Essay]. The essay that you need to evaluate is the text between the tag [Essay] and the tag [Task]. 
            
            ""Task Response"" evaluates how well the candidate fully answers the question and develops his or her ideas. Responses must be a minimum of 250 words. If the essay has 200-250 words, you should subtract 1 point from the Task Response score you would like to give to the student. If the essay has 20-200 words - subtract 2 points. If the essay has fewer than 20 words, you should assign a score of 1 for all criteria. If the essay is totally off-topic, you should assign a 2 to this criterion.
            ""Coherence and Cohesion"" evaluates the overall clarity and fluency of the message: how the response organizes and links information, ideas, and language. Coherence refers to the logical sequencing of ideas, while cohesion refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (for example, logical connectors, pronouns, and conjunctions) to clarify conceptual and referential relationships between and within sentences.
            ""Lexical Resource"" refers to the range of vocabulary the candidate has used, as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of that use in relation to the specific task. Academic style is welcomed, you should subtract 2 points if the essay is not academic. 
            ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy refers to the variety and accuracy of the candidate's grammar, including the use of punctuation.
            
            You will provide detailed feedback and scores for each criterion, scores are a must have. The feedback must include evidence from the original essay and reference the grading criteria to support your ideas.
            
            The output format should include:
            • ""Task Response feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes word count, overall correspondence between topic and essay, and unity of ideas in each paragraph. If the essay is off-topic, you should point this out with evidence.  
            • ""Coherence and Cohesion feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes use of linking words and number of paragraphs. Appropriate use of linking words and substitutions should be rewarded. The desired number of paragraphs is between 3 and 10. Essays that do not follow this structure should be penalized. 
            • ""Lexical Resource feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes number and example of B2, C1, C2 words based on CEFR complexity, noticeable word repetition, spelling mistakes. Appropriate and more complicated words will be rewarded; inappropriate word choice, oral style, and noticeable word repetition will be penalized. Spelling errors should be corrected. 
            • ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes grammar concepts used, grammar errors, use of complex sentences, including B2, C1, C2 sentences based on CEFR complexity, clauses, sentence length, punctuation errors. Complex sentences and the variety of grammatical resources used should be rewarded. Grammar and punctuation errors should be penalized and corrected.
            
            Based on the [Fixed Criteria] provided earlier and the feedback for each criterion, you are required to assign scores in the following format:
            • ""Task Response score"": An integer score from 1 to 9.      
            • ""Coherence and Cohesion score"": An integer score from 1 to 9.
            • ""Lexical Resource score"": An integer score from 1 to 9.
            • ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy score"": An integer score from 1 to 9.
            Remember, your feedback should be supported with quotes from the original essay. 
            
            The output should look like this and each key should strictly have the name demonstrated bellow: 
            ""Task Response feedback"": 2-5 sentences with all evidence, ""Coherence and Cohesion feedback"":  2-5 sentences with all evidence, ""Lexical Resource feedback"":  2-5 sentences with all evidence, ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy feedback"":  2-5 sentences with all evidence, ""Task Response score"": an integer, ""Coherence and Cohesion score"": an integer, ""Lexical Resource score"": an integer, ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy score"": an integer.
            
            Please ensure that your output is formatted strictly in JSON, and it has 6 elements as shown above."
"Recently published figures show that the wildlife population around the world has decreased by around fifty per cent over the last fifty years. What can we do to help protect the wildlife round the world?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.","Humans have become a prime culprit for the destruction of the wildlife population around the world. Humans believe that they are the most powerful species on this planet and have therefore chosen to use all of nature’s resources for their own good, even if this results in the destruction of the environment around them. Clearly, this is not a positive result of human existence and many people believe that the world’s wildlife population should be better protected.

One possible way to protect wildlife around the world is to reduce the amount of polluted substances produced through the human way of life. It has become habitual for people to pollute water by adding chemicals to it during industrial processes or to pollute air as a result of the fossil fuel industries and car emissions. Stopping the addition of chemicals to water and creating cleaner processes would reduce water pollution and help create a safer environment for wildlife to live in. Increasing the availability and use of public transportation and increasing the use of renewable energy sources could reduce world pollution further.


Another possible attempt to protect wildlife around the world is to actively promote recycling projects to reduce the amount of resources that are wasted. This would lessen the degradation of the natural environment, as humans continue to search for new resources. Society uses a lot of paper and wood on a daily basis and people do not actively think about whether or not they are wasting these resources. Printing double-sided or on recycled paper for example would appear to change nothing, yet if carried out regularly would help make a difference.

In conclusion, there are numerous different ways in which every human being can help to protect the wildlife population around the world. One can engage in projects to raise awareness of environmental destruction or one can actively take part in activities to protect it. Everyone must find the area in which he or she would like to involve him or herself, as all should be obliged to protect wildlife around the world.","[Fixed Criteria]

"Many parents give jobs to their children to do around the house in order to develop their characters and self-sufficiency.
Discuss this idea and give your opinion.","In many modern day families, it is a common aspect of family life that parents give jobs to their children to do around the house to develop their characters and a sense of self-sufficiency. This aspect can be looked at as having both positive and negative sides.

When parents give their children jobs or chores to do around the house, they make their children understand that they are part of a community. While this community is only within the family’s house, the lessons children learn from carrying out their chores are equally fitting for the global community they live in. Children are taught that they have to integrate into the global community and that in order for this community to work effectively, everyone must carry out their chores.


Furthermore, children learn about the concept of pride, as they are taught to be proud of what they have accomplished. Chores around the house additionally prepare children for living independently later on in life, as they acquire skills that are valuable for everyday life. I, personally, see this approach as very practical; helping my mother with cooking in my childhood and teenage years served me well, and living independently now I don’t have trouble preparing meals for myself and my housemates.

Although there are many supporters of this concept, some parents argue that children should not be given jobs to do around the house. They argue that children should be allowed to be children and not have any duties. In their opinion children should enjoy their childhood and should not have to deal with any of the responsibilities adults have to deal with.


In conclusion, I believe that giving children chores to carry out is a positive aspect of family life, as I think that it helps children to become independent and makes it easier for them to live by themselves later on in life.","[Fixed Criteria]

    ""Many parents give jobs to their children to do around the house in order to develop their characters and self-sufficiency.
Discuss this idea and give your opinion.""

    [Essay]
    ""In many modern day families, it is a common aspect of family life that parents give jobs to their children to do around the house to develop their characters and a sense of self-sufficiency. This aspect can be looked at as having both positive and negative sides.

When parents give their children jobs or chores to do around the house, they make their children understand that they are part of a community. While this community is only within the family’s house, the lessons children learn from carrying out their chores are equally fitting for the global community they live in. Children are taught that they have to integrate into the global community and that in order for this community to work effectively, everyone must carry out their chores.


Furthermore, children learn about the concept of pride, as they are taught to be proud of what they have accomplished. Chores around the house additionally prepare children for living independently later on in life, as they acquire skills that are valuable for everyday life. I, personally, see this approach as very practical; helping my mother with cooking in my childhood and teenage years served me well, and living independently now I don’t have trouble preparing meals for myself and my housemates.

Although there are many supporters of this concept, some parents argue that children should not be given jobs to do around the house. They argue that children should be allowed to be children and not have any duties. In their opinion children should enjoy their childhood and should not have to deal with any of the responsibilities adults have to deal with.


In conclusion, I believe that giving children chores to carry out is a positive aspect of family life, as I think that it helps children to become independent and makes it easier for them to live by themselves later on in life.""
    
            [Task]
            You are an IELTS examiner, and you are required to evaluate an IELTS academic essay based on four specific criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. Each criterion should be rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 represents the highest level of proficiency and 1 the lowest.
            The detailed criteria is the text till the tag [Topic]. The essay topic is the text between [Topic] and the tag [Essay]. The essay that you need to evaluate is the text between the tag [Essay] and the tag [Task]. 
            
            ""Task Response"" evaluates how well the candidate fully answers the question and develops his or her ideas. Responses must be a minimum of 250 words. If the essay has 200-250 words, you should subtract 1 point from the Task Response score you would like to give to the student. If the essay has 20-200 words - subtract 2 points. If the essay has fewer than 20 words, you should assign a score of 1 for all criteria. If the essay is totally off-topic, you should assign a 2 to this criterion.
            ""Coherence and Cohesion"" evaluates the overall clarity and fluency of the message: how the response organizes and links information, ideas, and language. Coherence refers to the logical sequencing of ideas, while cohesion refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (for example, logical connectors, pronouns, and conjunctions) to clarify conceptual and referential relationships between and within sentences.
            ""Lexical Resource"" refers to the range of vocabulary the candidate has used, as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of that use in relation to the specific task. Academic style is welcomed, you should subtract 2 points if the essay is not academic. 
            ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy refers to the variety and accuracy of the candidate's grammar, including the use of punctuation.
            
            You will provide detailed feedback and scores for each criterion, scores are a must have. The feedback must include evidence from the original essay and reference the grading criteria to support your ideas.
            
            The output format should include:
            • ""Task Response feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes word count, overall correspondence between topic and essay, and unity of ideas in each paragraph. If the essay is off-topic, you should point this out with evidence.  
            • ""Coherence and Cohesion feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes use of linking words and number of paragraphs. Appropriate use of linking words and substitutions should be rewarded. The desired number of paragraphs is between 3 and 10. Essays that do not follow this structure should be penalized. 
            • ""Lexical Resource feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes number and example of B2, C1, C2 words based on CEFR complexity, noticeable word repetition, spelling mistakes. Appropriate and more complicated words will be rewarded; inappropriate word choice, oral style, and noticeable word repetition will be penalized. Spelling errors should be corrected. 
            • ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes grammar concepts used, grammar errors, use of complex sentences, including B2, C1, C2 sentences based on CEFR complexity, clauses, sentence length, punctuation errors. Complex sentences and the variety of grammatical resources used should be rewarded. Grammar and punctuation errors should be penalized and corrected.
            
            Based on the [Fixed Criteria] provided earlier and the feedback for each criterion, you are required to assign scores in the following format:
            • ""Task Response score"": An integer score from 1 to 9.      
            • ""Coherence and Cohesion score"": An integer score from 1 to 9.
            • ""Lexical Resource score"": An integer score from 1 to 9.
            • ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy score"": An integer score from 1 to 9.
            Remember, your feedback should be supported with quotes from the original essay. 
            
            The output should look like this and each key should strictly have the name demonstrated bellow: 
            ""Task Response feedback"": 2-5 sentences with all evidence, ""Coherence and Cohesion feedback"":  2-5 sentences with all evidence, ""Lexical Resource feedback"":  2-5 sentences with all evidence, ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy feedback"":  2-5 sentences with all evidence, ""Task Response score"": an integer, ""Coherence and Cohesion score"": an integer, ""Lexical Resource score"": an integer, ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy score"": an integer.
            
            Please ensure that your output is formatted strictly in JSON, and it has 6 elements as shown above."
"It must be a woman who stays at home to care for children. Men are not suited to this kind of work. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.
","Traditionally in many parts of the world, it has been women who have stayed at home to care for children. This has led to the ideology and expectation that women are more suited to this type of work than men.

The overwhelming status quo where women stay at home to care for the children probably derives from the fact that women are the ones who have to actually give birth to children and, following that, they are the ones who for the early part of a child’s life have to feed the child until it is weaned. In times past, this state of affairs probably led to the women assuming the permanent role of carer for the home and children, whilst men went out to work, whether it was to gather food or work in fields or factories.


In spite of the fact that this became what was expected in family dynamics, it does not mean that men are necessarily less suited to caring for a child than women. It is very possible for men to care for a child, even from birth onwards in today’s world. Babies’ milk formula can be mixed by anyone and fed to a child. The fact that many women today choose not to do this again does not mean that they are better suited by nature to care for the child.

Suitability for childcare is a matter for individual temperament and aptitude. Not many people, whether they are men or women, feel totally confident and knowledgeable about how to care for a baby or young child at the start. They need advice from their own mothers and fathers, midwives or from books. It is only from experience that skill with childcare comes and this skill can be acquired regardless of gender.


All in all, I do not agree with the statement that men are less suited to childcare than women. I believe that aptitude to look after children is a matter of individual temperament, not gender-specific inherited qualities.","[Fixed Criteria]

"Some people today believe that the world’s increase in population is unsustainable and will eventually lead to a global crisis. Other people believe that world population increase is necessary and beneficial as it creates the growth of the world’s economy and society.

Discuss both these views and give your opinion.
","The population of the world is ever growing. Some people believe that this increase has created an unsustainable situation and that it will lead to a global crisis. Other people believe that only through an increasing population can the world’s economy and society develop.

This population increase is not constant around the world; population is undergoing significant growth especially in less developed countries, and the continent of Africa is predicted to undergo the highest increase. Many people living in these less developed countries frequently face shortages, such as water, food, heating, cooking fuel and medicines, and people have to live in substandard living conditions by western standards. With more inhabitants, these difficulties will become exacerbated and helping these countries might also create strain on the resources and economies of other countries.


On the other hand, many countries are unable to reach their economic potential due to a lack of skilled work forces. For these countries a growing population can mean a stronger economy and, due to that, a better standard of living. Growing populations can also lead to growing demand for goods, allowing economies to expand. The problem is, however, that countries that are in need of labour forces and increasing demand are already the more developed countries and they meet some of these needs by immigration and exporting goods.

In conclusion, it is my belief that while certain areas of the world are in need of larger work forces to develop their economies, the continuously increasing population could potentially lead to crisis within countries that already struggle to provide for their inhabitants.","[Fixed Criteria]

    ""Some people today believe that the world’s increase in population is unsustainable and will eventually lead to a global crisis. Other people believe that world population increase is necessary and beneficial as it creates the growth of the world’s economy and society.

Discuss both these views and give your opinion.
""

    [Essay]
    ""The population of the world is ever growing. Some people believe that this increase has created an unsustainable situation and that it will lead to a global crisis. Other people believe that only through an increasing population can the world’s economy and society develop.

This population increase is not constant around the world; population is undergoing significant growth especially in less developed countries, and the continent of Africa is predicted to undergo the highest increase. Many people living in these less developed countries frequently face shortages, such as water, food, heating, cooking fuel and medicines, and people have to live in substandard living conditions by western standards. With more inhabitants, these difficulties will become exacerbated and helping these countries might also create strain on the resources and economies of other countries.


On the other hand, many countries are unable to reach their economic potential due to a lack of skilled work forces. For these countries a growing population can mean a stronger economy and, due to that, a better standard of living. Growing populations can also lead to growing demand for goods, allowing economies to expand. The problem is, however, that countries that are in need of labour forces and increasing demand are already the more developed countries and they meet some of these needs by immigration and exporting goods.

In conclusion, it is my belief that while certain areas of the world are in need of larger work forces to develop their economies, the continuously increasing population could potentially lead to crisis within countries that already struggle to provide for their inhabitants.""
    
            [Task]
            You are an IELTS examiner, and you are required to evaluate an IELTS academic essay based on four specific criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. Each criterion should be rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 represents the highest level of proficiency and 1 the lowest.
            The detailed criteria is the text till the tag [Topic]. The essay topic is the text between [Topic] and the tag [Essay]. The essay that you need to evaluate is the text between the tag [Essay] and the tag [Task]. 
            
            ""Task Response"" evaluates how well the candidate fully answers the question and develops his or her ideas. Responses must be a minimum of 250 words. If the essay has 200-250 words, you should subtract 1 point from the Task Response score you would like to give to the student. If the essay has 20-200 words - subtract 2 points. If the essay has fewer than 20 words, you should assign a score of 1 for all criteria. If the essay is totally off-topic, you should assign a 2 to this criterion.
            ""Coherence and Cohesion"" evaluates the overall clarity and fluency of the message: how the response organizes and links information, ideas, and language. Coherence refers to the logical sequencing of ideas, while cohesion refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (for example, logical connectors, pronouns, and conjunctions) to clarify conceptual and referential relationships between and within sentences.
            ""Lexical Resource"" refers to the range of vocabulary the candidate has used, as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of that use in relation to the specific task. Academic style is welcomed, you should subtract 2 points if the essay is not academic. 
            ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy refers to the variety and accuracy of the candidate's grammar, including the use of punctuation.
            
            You will provide detailed feedback and scores for each criterion, scores are a must have. The feedback must include evidence from the original essay and reference the grading criteria to support your ideas.

Evidence includes use of linking words and number of paragraphs. Appropriate use of linking words and substitutions should be rewarded. The desired number of paragraphs is between 3 and 10. Essays that do not follow this structure should be penalized. 
            • ""Lexical Resource feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes number and example of B2, C1, C2 words based on CEFR complexity, noticeable word repetition, spelling mistakes. Appropriate and more complicated words will be rewarded; inappropriate word choice, oral style, and noticeable word repetition will be penalized. Spelling errors should be corrected. 
            • ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes grammar concepts used, grammar errors, use of complex sentences, including B2, C1, C2 sentences based on CEFR complexity, clauses, sentence length, punctuation errors. Complex sentences and the variety of grammatical resources used should be rewarded. Grammar and punctuation errors should be penalized and corrected.
            
            Based on the [Fixed Criteria] provided earlier and the feedback for each criterion, you are required to assign scores in the following format:

"There is a moral necessity today for the richer countries of the world to help the poorer countries develop in terms of feeding the population, education and health care. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","The world today is often divided into two categories, more developed and less developed countries. This division is significant in terms of health, wealth and education. To minimise this gap, it is argued that richer countries are morally responsible to support the less wealthy. I, personally, feel that the prosperous countries are obligated and expected to to contribute to the development of countries with weaker economies.

To address this argument, the history of the wealthy countries is relevant. Many less developed countries are former colonies, therefore the wealthy countries had a historical impact on the less wealthy. Thus, richer countries’ economies were dependent on the currently less developed countries for their rich status. Furthermore, even today the wealthy countries contribute to the wealth inequality by exploiting the inhabitants of less developed countries, giving workers lower wages than people within their own countries. Due to this dependence on poorer countries and the influence that the richer countries have had on the imbalance, it can be concluded that richer countries are indeed morally obliged to help the less wealthy countries.


Opposing this is the view that each country is in charge of their own inhabitants and that therefore they need to provide health, education and basic necessities for themselves. In addition, simply providing these three services would not lead to closing the wealth gap. It would rather be helpful to invest sustainably in poorer countries and help them create their own systems, allowing these countries to be self-sufficient.

In conclusion, while there is a moral necessity for wealthy countries to aid the poorer ones, simply providing basic necessities is not sufficient. A more sustainable idea would be to teach countries to plan and provide for themselves by giving economic incentives.","[Fixed Criteria]

Some people believe that the problem of illegal drugs can be solved by legalising all drugs. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?,"Illegal drugs have become a worldwide problem in modern day society. The trading of drugs is widespread in nearly all countries and the number of people consuming drugs worldwide is high. It has been suggested simply to legalise all recreational drugs to solve the problems associated with them. I personally agree partially with this proposal, because I can see many advantages, yet also many disadvantages.

One positive aspect of legalising these drugs would be that the number of criminal activities committed to obtain them would decrease. Fewer people would therefore be imprisoned and have a criminal history that prevents them from progressing in life. Additionally, essential police resources would be freed up and devoted to other areas. Finally, high taxes could be imposed on the legal product, allowing governments to have better resources to improve the infrastructure of their countries.


Although legalising all illegal drugs could result in several positive effects, there are many negative effects that could be possible. As a result of the legalisation, I personally believe that it would become acceptable to use drugs and people would no longer pay attention to the damage that drugs cause. Schools might no longer educate teenagers and adolescents about the negative effects drugs have on people, resulting in more teenagers experimenting with them, as they would believe that this is a normal aspect of life. This would result in a higher number of drug addicts and potentially in more deaths, because it would be easier to obtain a large amount of illegal drugs and therefore the chances of overdosing would also increase.

In conclusion, I partially agree with the proposed action. Nonetheless, I think that an age restriction should be placed on drug use, as teenagers and adolescents could easily become addicted if all illegal drugs are legalised. This group of people is highly at risk of becoming addicted and potentially dying as a result of drug use and therefore should only be allowed to consume drugs after reaching a certain age.","[Fixed Criteria]

- 5 means ""The main parts of the prompt are incompletely addressed. The format may be inappropriate in places. The writer expresses a position, but the development is not always clear. Some main ideas are put forward, but they are limited and are not sufficiently developed and/or there may be irrelevant detail. There may be some repetition."" A
- 4 means ""The prompt is tackled in a minimal way, or the answer is tangential, possibly due to some misunderstanding of the prompt. The format may be inappropriate. A position is discernible, but the reader has to read carefully to find it. Main ideas are difficult to identify and such ideas that are identifiable may lack relevance, clarity and/or support. Large parts of the response may be repetitive.""
- 3 means ""No part of the prompt is adequately addressed, or the prompt has been misunderstood. No relevant position can be identified, and/or there is little direct response to the question/s. There are few ideas, and these may be irrelevant or insufficiently developed.""
- 2 means ""The content is barely related to the prompt. No position can be identified. There may be glimpses of one or two ideas without development.""
- 1 means ""Responses of 20 words or fewer are rated at Band 1. The content is wholly unrelated to the prompt.""
For ""Coherence and Cohesion"":
- 9 (the highest band) means ""The message can be followed effortlessly. Cohesion is used in such a way that it very rarely attracts attention. Any lapses in coherence or cohesion are minimal. Paragraphing is skilfully managed.
- 8 means ""The message can be followed with ease. Information and ideas are logically sequenced, and cohesion is well managed. Occasional lapses in coherence or cohesion may occur. Paragraphing is used sufficiently and appropriately.""
- 7 means ""Information and ideas are logically organised and there is a clear progression throughout the response. A few lapses may occur. A range of cohesive devices including reference and substitution is used flexibly but with some inaccuracies or some over/under use""
- 6 means ""Information and ideas are generally arranged coherently and there is a clear overall progression. Cohesive devices are used to some good effect but cohesion within and/or between sentences may be faulty or mechanical due to misuse, overuse or omission. The use of reference and substitution may lack flexibility or clarity and result in some repetition or error.
- 5 means ""Organisation is evident but is not wholly logical and there may be a lack of overall progression. Nevertheless, there is a sense of underlying coherence to the response. The relationship of ideas can be followed but the sentences are not fluently linked to each other. There may be limited/overuse of cohesive devices with some inaccuracy. The writing may be repetitive due to inadequate and/or inaccurate use of reference and substitution.""
- 4 means ""Information and ideas are evident but not arranged coherently, and there is no clear progression within the response. Relationships between ideas can be unclear and/or inadequately marked. There is some use of basic cohesive devices, which may be inaccurate or repetitive. There is inaccurate use or a lack of substitution or referencing.""
- 3 means ""There is no apparent logical organisation. Ideas are discernible but difficult to relate to each other. Minimal use of sequencers or cohesive devices. Those used do not necessarily indicate a logical relationship between ideas. There is difficulty in identifying referencing.""
- 2 means ""There is little relevant message, or the entire response may be off-topic. There is little evidence of control of organisational features.""
- 1 means ""Responses of 20 words or fewer are rated at Band 1. The writing fails to communicate any message and appears to be by a virtual non-writer.""
For ""Lexical Resource"":
- 9 (the highest score) means ""Full flexibility and precise use are evident within the scope of the task. A wide range of vocabulary is used accurately and appropriately with very natural and sophisticated control of lexical features. Minor errors in spelling and word formation are extremely rare and have minimal impact on communication.""
- 8 means ""A wide resource is fluently and flexibly used to convey precise meanings within the scope of the task. There is skilful use of uncommon and/or 
idiomatic items when appropriate, despite occasional inaccuracies in word choice and collocation. Occasional errors in spelling and/or word formation may occur, but have minimal impact on communication.""
- 7 means ""The resource is sufficient to allow some flexibility and precision. There is some ability to use less common and/or idiomatic items. An awareness of style and collocation is evident, though inappropriacies occur. There are only a few errors in spelling and/or word formation, and they do not detract from overall clarity"".
- 6 means ""The resource is generally adequate and appropriate for the task. The meaning is generally clear in spite of a rather restricted range or a lack of precision in word choice. If the writer is a risk-taker, there will be a wider range of vocabulary used but higher degrees of inaccuracy or inappropriacy.There are some errors in spelling and/or word formation, but these do not impede communication.""
- 5 means ""The resource is limited but minimally adequate for the task. Simple vocabulary may be used accurately but the range does not permit much variation in expression.

Errors in spelling and/or word formation may be noticeable and may cause some difficulty for the reader.""
- 4 means ""The resource is limited and inadequate for or unrelated to the task. Vocabulary is basic and may be used repetitively. There may be inappropriate use of lexical chunks (e.g. memorised phrases, formulaic language and/or language from the input material). Inappropriate word choice and/or errors in word formation and/or in spelling may impede meaning.""
- 3 means ""The resource is inadequate (which may be due to the response being significantly underlength).Possible over-dependence on input material or memorised language. Control of word choice and/or spelling is very limited, and errors predominate. These errors may severely impede meaning"".

- 7 means ""A variety of complex structures is used with  some flexibility and accuracy. Grammar and punctuation are generally well  controlled, and error-free sentences are  frequent. A few errors in grammar may persist, but  these do not impede communication.""
- 6 means ""A mix of simple and complex sentence  forms is used but flexibility is limited. Examples of more complex structures are  not marked by the same level of accuracy  as in simple structures. Errors in grammar and punctuation occur,  but rarely impede communication"".
- 5 means ""The range of structures is limited and  rather repetitive. Although complex sentences are  attempted, they tend to be faulty, and the  greatest accuracy is achieved on simple  sentences. Grammatical errors may be frequent and  cause some difficulty for the reader. Punctuation may be faulty.""
- 4 means ""A very limited range of structures is  used. Subordinate clauses are rare and  simple sentences predominate. Some structures are produced accurately  but grammatical errors are frequent and  may impede meaning. Punctuation is often faulty or inadequate"".
- 3 means ""Sentence forms are attempted, but  errors in grammar and punctuation  predominate (except in memorised phrases or those taken from the input  material). This prevents most meaning  from coming through. Length may be insufficient to provide  evidence of control of sentence forms.""
- 2 means ""There is little or no evidence of sentence forms (except in memorised phrases).""
- 1 means ""Responses of 20 words or fewer are  rated at Band 1.  No rateable language is evident.""

    [Topic]
    ""Some people believe that the problem of illegal drugs can be solved by legalising all drugs. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?""

    [Essay]
    ""Illegal drugs have become a worldwide problem in modern day society. The trading of drugs is widespread in nearly all countries and the number of people consuming drugs worldwide is high. It has been suggested simply to legalise all recreational drugs to solve the problems associated with them. I personally agree partially with this proposal, because I can see many advantages, yet also many disadvantages.

One positive aspect of legalising these drugs would be that the number of criminal activities committed to obtain them would decrease. Fewer people would therefore be imprisoned and have a criminal history that prevents them from progressing in life. Additionally, essential police resources would be freed up and devoted to other areas. Finally, high taxes could be imposed on the legal product, allowing governments to have better resources to improve the infrastructure of their countries.


Although legalising all illegal drugs could result in several positive effects, there are many negative effects that could be possible. As a result of the legalisation, I personally believe that it would become acceptable to use drugs and people would no longer pay attention to the damage that drugs cause. Schools might no longer educate teenagers and adolescents about the negative effects drugs have on people, resulting in more teenagers experimenting with them, as they would believe that this is a normal aspect of life. This would result in a higher number of drug addicts and potentially in more deaths, because it would be easier to obtain a large amount of illegal drugs and therefore the chances of overdosing would also increase.

In conclusion, I partially agree with the proposed action. Nonetheless, I think that an age restriction should be placed on drug use, as teenagers and adolescents could easily become addicted if all illegal drugs are legalised. This group of people is highly at risk of becoming addicted and potentially dying as a result of drug use and therefore should only be allowed to consume drugs after reaching a certain age.""
    
            [Task]
            You are an IELTS examiner, and you are required to evaluate an IELTS academic essay based on four specific criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. Each criterion should be rated on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 represents the highest level of proficiency and 1 the lowest.
            The detailed criteria is the text till the tag [Topic]. The essay topic is the text between [Topic] and the tag [Essay]. The essay that you need to evaluate is the text between the tag [Essay] and the tag [Task]. 
            
            ""Task Response"" evaluates how well the candidate fully answers the question and develops his or her ideas. Responses must be a minimum of 250 words. If the essay has 200-250 words, you should subtract 1 point from the Task Response score you would like to give to the student. If the essay has 20-200 words - subtract 2 points. If the essay has fewer than 20 words, you should assign a score of 1 for all criteria. If the essay is totally off-topic, you should assign a 2 to this criterion.
            ""Coherence and Cohesion"" evaluates the overall clarity and fluency of the message: how the response organizes and links information, ideas, and language. Coherence refers to the logical sequencing of ideas, while cohesion refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (for example, logical connectors, pronouns, and conjunctions) to clarify conceptual and referential relationships between and within sentences.
            ""Lexical Resource"" refers to the range of vocabulary the candidate has used, as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of that use in relation to the specific task. Academic style is welcomed, you should subtract 2 points if the essay is not academic. 
            ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy refers to the variety and accuracy of the candidate's grammar, including the use of punctuation.
            
            You will provide detailed feedback and scores for each criterion, scores are a must have. The feedback must include evidence from the original essay and reference the grading criteria to support your ideas.
            
            The output format should include:
            • ""Task Response feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes word count, overall correspondence between topic and essay, and unity of ideas in each paragraph. If the essay is off-topic, you should point this out with evidence.  
            • ""Coherence and Cohesion feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes use of linking words and number of paragraphs. Appropriate use of linking words and substitutions should be rewarded. The desired number of paragraphs is between 3 and 10. Essays that do not follow this structure should be penalized. 
            • ""Lexical Resource feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes number and example of B2, C1, C2 words based on CEFR complexity, noticeable word repetition, spelling mistakes. Appropriate and more complicated words will be rewarded; inappropriate word choice, oral style, and noticeable word repetition will be penalized. Spelling errors should be corrected. 
            • ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy feedback"": Feedback based on the [Fixed Criteria], supported by evidence from the original essay. Evidence includes grammar concepts used, grammar errors, use of complex sentences, including B2, C1, C2 sentences based on CEFR complexity, clauses, sentence length, punctuation errors. Complex sentences and the variety of grammatical resources used should be rewarded. Grammar and punctuation errors should be penalized and corrected.
            
            Based on the [Fixed Criteria] provided earlier and the feedback for each criterion, you are required to assign scores in the following format:
            • ""Task Response score"": An integer score from 1 to 9.      
            • ""Coherence and Cohesion score"": An integer score from 1 to 9.
            • ""Lexical Resource score"": An integer score from 1 to 9.
            • ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy score"": An integer score from 1 to 9.
            Remember, your feedback should be supported with quotes from the original essay. 
            
            The output should look like this and each key should strictly have the name demonstrated bellow: 
            ""Task Response feedback"": 2-5 sentences with all evidence, ""Coherence and Cohesion feedback"":  2-5 sentences with all evidence, ""Lexical Resource feedback"":  2-5 sentences with all evidence, ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy feedback"":  2-5 sentences with all evidence, ""Task Response score"": an integer, ""Coherence and Cohesion score"": an integer, ""Lexical Resource score"": an integer, ""Grammatical Range and Accuracy score"": an integer.
            
            Please ensure that your output is formatted strictly in JSON, and it has 6 elements as shown above."
